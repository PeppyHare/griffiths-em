This is basically just a web-friendly version of David Griffiths' [Introduction to Electrodynamics, 4th Ed.](https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Griffiths-Introduction-to-Electrodynamics-4th-Edition/PGM249908.html). These are my class notes for the University of Washington's PHYS 543/544 series. This is mostly an exercise for myself in learning about Mkdocs, MathJax, and physics!

Click around in the sidebar to find a chapter to read, or follow the links at the bottom of the page to read in order.

### Internals

All content is written in Markdown and rendered to a static site using [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/). The theme for the site is [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material). I use python-markdown-math to turn any LaTeX in my source into full-blown MathJax to be rendered in the browser (and in a mobile-friendly format!).
