# Griffiths - Introduction to Electrodynamics

This is a web-friendly version of David Griffiths' [Introduction to Electrodynamics, 4th Ed.](https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/program/Griffiths-Introduction-to-Electrodynamics-4th-Edition/PGM249908.html). I render source MarkDown using Mkdocs and python-markdown-math, so that all LaTeX is rendered in the browser in a mobile-friendly format.

This is mostly an exercise for myself in learning about Mkdocs, MathJax, and physics! As such, I will probably not work through all the examples and homework problems here.
