# 2.1: The Electric Field

## 2.1.1: Introduction

The fundamental problem electrodynamics hopes to solve is this (Fig 2.1): We have some electric charges \( q_1, q_2, q_3, \ldots \) (call them *source charges*); what force do they exert on another charge, \( Q \) (call it the *test charge*)? The positions of the source charges are given (as functions of time); the trajectory of the test particle is to be calculated. In general, both the source charges and the test charge are in motion.

The solution to this problem is facilitated by the principle of superposition, which states that the interaction between any two charges is completely unaffected by the presence of others. This means that to determine the force on Q, we can first compute the force \( \vec{F_1} \), due to \( q_1 \) alone (ignoring all the others); then we compute the force \( \vec{F_2} \), due to \( q_2 \) alone, and so in. Finally, we take the vector sum of all these individual forces: \( \vec{F} = \vec{F_1} + \vec{F_2} + \vec{F_3} + \ldots \) Thus, if we can find the force on Q due to a _single_ source charge \( q \), we are, in principle, done (the rest is just a question of repeating the same operation over and over, and adding it all up)


 > The principle of superposition may seem "obvious" to you, but it did not have to be so simple: if the electromagnetic force were proportional to the _square_ of the total source charge, for instance, the principle of superposition would not hold, since \( (q_1 + q_2)^2 \neq q_1 ^2 + q_2 ^2 \) (there would be "cross terms" to consider). Superposition is not a logical necessity, but an experimental fact.

Well, at first this looks very easy


This is an equation $$a = b \, \text{ and } \, b = c \rightarrow b = c \label{ref1}$$ and this is a reference to that equation \(\eqref{ref1}\)
