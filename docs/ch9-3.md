## 9.3: Electromagnetic Waves in Matter

### 9.3.1: Propagation in Linear Media and Non-conductors

Maxwell's equations in linear media are

$$
\begin{align*} (\text{i}) & \quad \div \vec{D} = \rho_f \quad \text{(Gauss's law)} \\ (\text{ii}) & \quad \div \vec{B} = 0 \quad \text{(Ng's Law)} \\ (\text{iii}) & \quad \curl \vec{E} = - \pdv{\vec{B}}{t} \quad \text{(Faraday's Law}) \\ (\text{iv}) & \quad \curl \vec{H} = \vec{J}_f + \pdv{\vec{D}}{t} \quad \text{(Ampere's Law)} \end{align*}  $$

In _linear_ media, our constitutive relations are
$$
\vec D = \epsilon_0 \vec E + \vec P = \epsilon \vec E
$$
and
$$
\vec H = \frac{\vec B}{\mu_0} - \vec M = \frac{\vec B}{\mu}
$$

In charge-free region, the Maxwell equations in linear media look a lot like those in vacuum

$$
\rho_f = 0 \qquad \vec J_f = 0
$$
$$
\rightarrow \begin{align*} (\text{i}) & \quad \div \vec E = 0 \\
(\text{ii}) & \div \vec B = 0 \\
(\text{iii}) & \curl \vec E = - \pdv{\vec B}{t} \\
(\text{iv}) & \curl \vec B = \mu \epsilon \pdv{\vec E}{t} \end{align*}
$$
So that's nearly identical, except where we had \( \epsilon_0 \) now we have \( \epsilon \), and where we had \( \mu_0 \) now we have \( \mu \), so we can make these same substitutions in the solutions. The resulting wave equations in linear matter are

$$
\nabla ^2 \vec E = \frac{1}{v^2} \frac{\partial ^2 \vec E}{\partial t^2} \qquad \nabla ^2 \vec B = \frac{1}{v^2} \frac{\partial ^2 \vec B}{\partial t^2} 
 $$ 
where now the speed is
$$
v = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu \epsilon}} = \text{speed of EM wave in linear medium} = \frac{c}{n}
$$
where
$$
n \equiv \sqrt{\frac{\mu}{\mu_0} \frac{\epsilon}{\epsilon_0}} = \text{ index of refraction }
$$

### 9.3.2: Reflection and Transmission at Normal Incidence

On of the most simple interesting situations that can arise when the index of refraction changes is when light crosses a sudden interface, i.e., what happens when light passes from one transparent medium into another? As in the case of waves on a string, we expect to get a reflected wave and a transmitted wave. Suppose we have waves incident on the boundary (in the x-y plane) between two media, call the media "1" and "2" with indices of refraction \( n_1 \) and \( n_2 \). The z-axis is normal to the boundary.

Let's write our incident wave \( \vec{E_I} \)  in so-called "phasor notation" (just complex exponential notation)
$$
\vec{E_I} (\vec r, t) = \vec{E_{0, I}} e^{i(\vec{k_I} \cdot \vec r - \omega t}
$$
where the actual wave itself is the real part of the complex exponential. We define the magnetic field in the same way
$$
\vec{B_I} (\vec r, t) = \vec{B_{0, I}} e^{i(\vec{k_I} \cdot \vec r - \omega t)} = \frac{1}{v_1} ( \vec{k_I} \cross \vec{E_I})
$$
We write down similar expressions
$$
\vec{E_{R}}, \quad \vec{B_{R}}
$$
for the reflected wave, and
$$
\vec{E_{T}}, \quad \vec{B_{T}}
$$
for the transmitted wave. At the \( z = 0 \) plane
$$
\vec{E_{0,I}} e^{i(\vec{k_I} \cdot \vec r - \omega t)} + \vec{E_{0,R}} e^{i(\vec{k_R} \cdot \vec r - \omega t)} = \vec{E_{0,T}} e^{i(\vec{k_T} \cdot \vec r - \omega t)}
$$
That's true for all \( x, y \) on the interface and for all time, so this immediately implies that \( \omega \) has to be the same for each of the waves (we already implicitly assumed this in the notation). So the \( \omega t \) terms drop out of all three terms, and we can focus on the wavenumbers. It has to be the case that
$$
\vec{k_I} \cdot \vec r = \vec{k_R} \cdot \vec r = \vec{k_T} \cdot \vec r
$$
$$
\rightarrow k_{I, x}x + k_{I, y} y = k_{R, x}x + k_{R, y} y = k_{T, x}x + k_{T, y} y
$$
where so far there is no restriction on \( k_z \). We can simply orient our \( x-z \) axes such that \( \vec{k_I} \) lies in the \( x-z \) plane. This means that  \( \vec{k_R} \) and \( \vec{k_T} \) will also lie in the plane, and
$$
k_{I, x} = k_{I} \sin \theta_I = k_R \sin \theta_R \quad \rightarrow \quad \sin \theta_I = \sin \theta_R
$$
$$
\rightarrow \quad \theta_I = \theta_R
$$
$$
k_{I} \sin \theta_I = k_T \sin \theta_T \quad \rightarrow \frac{n_1}{n_2} \sin \theta_I = \sin \theta_T
$$
$$
\rightarrow \frac{\sin \theta_T}{\sin \theta_I} = \frac{n_1}{n_2}
$$
