# 4.2: The Field of a Polarized Object

## 4.2.1: Bound Charges

Suppose we have a piece of polarized material - that is, an object containing a lot of microscopic dipoles lined up. The dipole moment per unit volume __P__ is given. _Question_: What is the field produced by this object (not the field that may have caused the polarization, but the field the polarization itself causes)? Well, we know what the field of an individual dipole looks like, so why not chop the material up into infinitesimal dipoles and integrate to get the total? As usual, it's easier to work with the potential. For a single dipole __p__ (Eq. 3.99)
$$
V(\vec{r}) = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{\vec{p} \cdot \vu{\gr}}{\gr ^2} \tagl{4.8}
$$
where \( \vec{\gr} \) is the vector from the dipole to the point at which we are evaluating the potential (Fig 4.8). In the present context, we have a dipole moment \( \vec{p} = \vec{P} \dd \tau' \) in each volume element \( \dd \tau' \), so the total potential is
$$
V(\vec{r}) = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \int_{V} \frac{\vec{P}(\vec{r'}) \cdot \vu{\gr}}{\gr ^2} \dd \tau'
$$

![Figure 4.8](img/4.8.png)
That does it, in principle. But a little sleight of hand casts this integral into a much more illuminating form. Observing that
$$
\grad ' \left( \frac{1}{\gr} \right) = \frac{\vu{\gr}}{\gr ^2} 
$$
where the differentiation is with respect to the _source_ coordinates (r'), we have
$$
V = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \int _V \vec{P} \cdot \grad ' \left( \frac{1}{\gr} \right) \dd \tau'
$$
Peeling the \( \grad \) leftwards with integration by parts, we have
$$
V = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \left[ \int _V \grad' \cdot \left( \frac{\vec{P}}{\gr}  \right) \dd \tau' - \int _V \frac{1}{\gr} ( \grad' \cdot \vec{P} ) \dd \tau' \right]
$$
The left-hand integral is a volume integral of a divergence, so with Gauss's law
$$
V = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 } \oint _S \frac{1}{\gr } \vec{P} \cdot \dd \vec{a'} - \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \int _V \frac{1}{\gr} ( \grad' \cdot \vec{P} ) \dd \tau' \tagl{4.10}
$$
The first term looks like the potential of a surface charge
$$
\sigma_b \equiv \vec{P} \cdot \vu{n} \tagl{4.11}
$$
while the second term looks like the potential of a volume charge
$$
\rho_b \equiv - \div \vec{P} \tagl{4.12}
$$

With these definitions, \( \eqref{4.10} \) becomes
$$
V(\vec{r} = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \oint_S \frac{\sigma_b}{\gr} \dd a' + \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \int_V \frac{\rho_b}{\gr} \dd \tau' \tagl{4.13}
$$
What this means is that the potential (and hence also the field) of a polarized object is the same as that produced by a volume charge density \( \rho_b = - \div \vec{P} \) plus a surface charge density \( \sigma_b = \vec{P} \cdot \vu{n} \). Instead of integrating the contributions of all the infinitesimal dipoles, we could just find those __bound charges__, and then calculate the fields they produce, in the same way we calculate the field of any other volume and surface charges.

#### Example 4.2

!!! question "Find the electric field produced by a uniformly polarized sphere of radius R"

    ![Figure 4.9](img/4.9.png)
    __Solution__

    We may as well choose the z axis to coincide with the direction of polarization (Fig 4.9). The volume bound charge density \( \rho_b \) is zero, since \( \vec{P} \) is uniform. The surface bound charge density is then
    $$
    \sigma_b = \vec{P} \cdot \vu{n} = P \cos \theta
    $$
    where \( \theta \) is the usual spherical coordinate. What we want, then is the field produced by a charge density \( P \cos \theta \)  plastered over the surface of a sphere. We happen to have already computed that potential in Exercise 3.9:
    $$
    V(r, \theta) = \begin{cases}
    \frac{P}{3 \epsilon_0} r \cos \theta, & \qquad \text{ for } r \leq R \\
    \frac{P}{3 \epsilon_0} \frac{R^3}{r^2} \cos \theta, & \qquad \text{ for } r \geq R
    \end{cases}
    $$
    Since \( r \cos \theta = z \), the field inside the sphere is _uniform_:
    $$
    \vec{E} = - \grad V = - \frac{P}{3 \epsilon_0} \vu{z} = - \frac{1}{3 \epsilon_0} \vec{P} , \quad \text{ for } r < R \tagl{4.14}
    $$
    This is a pretty remarkable result, and will be very useful in what follows. Outside the sphere the potential is the same as that of a perfect dipole at the origin
    $$
    V = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{\vec{p} \cdot \vu{r}}{r^2} , \quad \text{ for } r \geq R \tagl{4.15}
    $$
    ![Figure 4.10](img/4.10.png)
    whose dipole moment is, not surprisingly, equal to the total dipole moment of the sphere:
    $$
    \vec{p} = \frac{4}{3} \pi R^3 \vec{P} \tagl{4.16}
    $$
    The field of the uniformly polarized sphere is shown in Fig 4.10.

## 4.2.2: Physical Interpretation of Bound Charges


In the last section we found that the field of a polarized object is identical to the field that would be produced by a certain distribution of "bound charges," \( \sigma_b \) and \( \rho_b \). But this conclusion emerged in the course of abstract manipulations on the integral in Eq. 4.9, and left us with no clue as to the physical meaning of these bound charges. Indeed, some authors give you the impression that bound charges are in some sense "fictitious" - mere bookkeeping devices used to facilitate the calculation of fields. Nothing could be further from the truth: \( \rho_b \) and \( \sigma_b \) represent perfectly genuine accumulations of charge. In this section I'll explain how polarization leads to these charge distributions.

![Figure 4.11](img/4.11.png)

The basic idea is very simple: Suppose we have a long string of dipoles, as shown in Fig. 4.11. Along the line, the head of one effectively cancels the tail of its neighbor, but at the ends there are two charges left over: plus at the right end and minus at the left. It is as if we had peeled off an electron at one end and carried it all the way down to the other end, though in fact no single electron made the whole trip - a lot of tiny displacements add up to one large one. We call the net charge at the ends a bound charge to remind ourselves that it cannot be removed; in a dielectric every electron is attached to a specific atom or molecule. But apart from that, bound charge is no different from any other kind.

![Figure 4.12](img/4.12.png)

To calculate the actual amount of bound charge resulting from a given polarization, examine a "tube" of dielectric parallel to P. The dipole moment of the tiny chunk shown in Fig. 4.12 is \( P(Ad) \), where A is the cross-sectional area of the tube and dis the length of the chunk. In terms of the charge (q) at the end, this same dipole moment can be written \( qd \). The bound charge that piles up at the right end of the tube is therefore
$$
q = PA
$$
If the ends have been sliced off perpendicularly, the surface charge density is
$$
\sigma_b = \frac{q}{A}  = P
$$
For an oblique cut (Fig 4.13), the charge is still the same, but \( A = A_{end} \cos \theta \) so
$$
\sigma_b = \frac{1}{A_{end}}  = P \cos \theta = \vec{P} \cdot \vu{n}
$$
The effect of the polarization, then, is to paint a bound charge \( \sigma_b = \vec{P} \cdot \vu{n} \) over the surface of the material. This is exactly what we found by more rigorous means in Sect. 4.2.1. But now we know where the bound charge comes from.

![Figure 4.14](img/4.14.png)

If the polarization is nonuniform, we get accumulations of bound charge within the material, as well as on the surface. A glance at Fig. 4.14 suggests that a diverging __P__ results in a pileup of negative charge. Indeed, the net bound charge \( \int \rho_b \dd \tau \) in a given volume is equal and opposite to the amount that has been pushed out through the surface. The latter (by the same reasoning we used before) is \( \vec{P} \cdot \vu{n} \) per unit area, so
$$
\int_v \rho_b \dd \tau = - \oint _S \vec{P} \cdot \dd \vec{a} = - \int_V (\div \vec{P}) \dd \tau
$$
Since this is true for any volume, we have
$$
\rho_b = - \div \vec{P}
$$
confirming, again, the more rigorous conclusion of Sect. 4.2.1.
