# 5.3: The Divergence and Curl of B

## 5.3.1: Straight-Line Currents

The magnetic field of an infinite straight wire is shown in Fig 5.27 (the current is coming out of the page). At a glance, it is clear that this field has a nonzero curl (something you'll never see in an electrostatic field); let's calculate it.

According to Eq. 5.38, the integral of __B__ around a circular path of radius _s_, centered at the wire, is
$$
\oint \vec{B} \cdot \dd l = \oint \frac{\mu_0 I}{2 \pi s}  = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2 \pi s } \oint \dd l = \mu_0 I
$$
Notice that the answer is independent of _s_; that's because _B_ decreases at the same rate as the circumference increases. In fact, it doesn't have to be a circle; any old loop that encloses the wire would give the same answer. For if we use cylindrical coordinates \( (s, \phi, z) \), with the current flowing along the z axis, \( \vec{B} = (\mu_0 I / 2 \pi s) \vu{\phi} \) and \( \dd \vec{l} = \dd s \, \vu{s} + s \dd \phi \, \vu{\phi} + \dd \z \, \vu{z} \)
