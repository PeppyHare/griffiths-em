## 2.5: Conductors

### 2.5.1: Basic Properties

In an _insulator_, such as glass or rubber, each electron is on a short leash, attached to a particular atom. In a metallic _conductor_, by contrast, one or more electrons per atom are free to roam. (In liquid conductors such as salt water, it is ions that do the moving). A _perfect_ conductor would contain an unlimited supply of free charges. In real life there are no perfect conductors, but metals come pretty close, for most purposes.

From this definition, the basic electrostatic properties of ideal conductors immediately follow
