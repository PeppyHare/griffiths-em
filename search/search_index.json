The positions of the source charges are given (as functions of time); the trajectory of the test particle is to be calculated. In general, both the source charges and the test charge are in motion. The solution to this problem is facilitated by the principle of superposition, which states that the interaction between any two charges is completely unaffected by the presence of others. This means that to determine the force on Q, we can first compute the force \\vec{F_1} , due to q_1 alone (ignoring all the others); then we compute the force \\vec{F_2} , due to q_2 alone, and so in. Finally, we take the vector sum of all these individual forces: \\vec{F} = \\vec{F_1} + \\vec{F_2} + \\vec{F_3} + \\ldots Thus, if we can find the force on Q due to a single source charge q , we are, in principle, done (the rest is just a question of repeating the same operation over and over, and adding it all up) The principle of superposition may seem \"obvious\" to you, but it did not have to be so simple: if the electromagnetic force were proportional to the square of the total source charge, for instance, the principle of superposition would not hold, since (q_1 + q_2)^2 \\neq q_1 ^2 + q_2 ^2 (there would be \"cross terms\" to consider). Superposition is not a logical necessity, but an experimental fact. Well, at first sight this looks very easy: Why don't I just write down the formula for the force on Q due to q, and be done with it? I could , and in Chapter 10 I shall, but you would be shocked to see it at this stage, for not only does the force on Q depend on the separation distance \\gr between the charges (Fig 2.2), it also depends on both their velocities and on the acceleration of q . Moreover, it is not the position, velocity, and acceleration of q right now that matter: electromagnetic \"news\" travels at the speed of light, so what concerns Q is the position, velocity, and acceleration q had at some earlier time, when the message left. Therefore, in spite of the fact that the basic question (\"What is the force on Q due to q?\") is easy to state, it does not pay to confront it head on; rather, we shall go at it by stages. In the meantime, the theory we develop will allow for the solution of more subtle electromagnetic problems that do not present themselves in quite this simple format. To begin with, we shall consider the special case of electrostatics in which all the source charges are stationary (though the test charge may be moving). 2.1.2: Coulomb's Law What is the force on a test charge Q due to a single point charge q, that is at rest a distance \\gr away? The answer (based on experiments) is given by Coulomb's Law : \\vec{F} = \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0}\\frac{q Q}{\\gr^2} \\hat{\\vec{\\gr}} \\label{coulomblaw} The constant \\epsilon_0 is called (ludicrously) the permittivity of free space . In SI units, where force is in newtons (N), distance in meters (m), and charge in coulombs (C), \\epsilon_0 = 8.85 \\times 10^{-12} \\frac{C^2}{N \\cdot m ^2} In words, the force is proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the separation distance. As always (Sect 1.1.4), \\vec{\\gr} is the separation vector from \\vec{r'} (the location of q) to \\vec{r} (the location of Q): \\vec{\\gr} = \\vec{r} - \\vec{r}' \\gr is its magnitude, and \\hat{\\gr} is its direction. The force points along the line from q to Q; it is repulsive if q and Q have the same sign, and attractive if their signs are opposite. Coulomb's law and the principle of superposition constitute the physical input for electrostatics - the rest, except for some special properties of matter, is mathematical elaboration of these fundamental rules. 2.1.3: The Electric Field If we have several point charges q_1, q_2, \\ldots , q_n at distances \\gr_1 \\gr_2 \\ldots, \\gr_n from Q , the total force on Q is evidently \\begin{align} \\vec{F} & = & \\vec{F_1} + \\vec{F_2} + \\ldots \\\\ & = & \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\left( \\frac{q_1 Q}{\\gr_1 ^2} \\hat{\\gr}_1 + \\frac{q_2 Q}{\\gr_2 ^2} \\hat{\\gr}_2 + \\ldots \\right) \\\\ & = & \\frac{Q}{4 \\pi \\epsilon _0} \\left( \\frac{q_1}{\\gr ^2 _1} \\hat{\\gr_1} + \\frac{q_2}{\\gr _2 ^2}\\hat{\\gr_2} + \\ldots \\right) \\end{align} or \\vec{F} = Q \\vec{E} \\label{2.3} where \\vec{E}(\\vec{r}) \\equiv \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\sum_{i = 1}^n \\frac{q_i}{\\gr_{i}^2} \\hat{\\gr_i} \\label{2.4} E is called the electric field of the source charges. Notice that it is a function of position ( r ), because the separation vectors \\gr_i depend on the location of the field point P (Fig 2.3). But it makes no reference to the test charge Q. The electric field is a vector quantity that varies from point to point and is determined by the configuration of source charges; physically, \\vec{E}(\\vec{r}) is the force per unit charge that would be exerted on a test charge, if you were to place one at P. What exactly is an electric field? I have deliberately begun with what you might call the \"minimal\" interpretation of E , as an intermediate step in the calculation of electric forces. But I encourage you to think of the field as a \"real\" physical entity, filling the space around electric charges. Maxwell himself came to believe that electric and magnetic fields are stresses and strains in an invisible primordial jellylike \"ether.\" Special relativity has forced us to abandon the notion of either, and with it Maxwell's mechanical interpretation of electromagnetic fields. (It is even possible, although cumbersome, to formulate classical electrodynamics as an \"action-at-a-distance\" theory, and dispense with the field concept altogether.) I can't tell you, then, what a field is -- only how to calculate it and what it can do for you once you've got it. 2.1.4: Continuous Charge Distributions Our definition of the electric field (Eq. \\eqref{2.4} ) assumes that the source of the field is a collection of discrete point charges q_i . If, instead, the charge is distributed continuously over some region, the sum becomes an integral (Fig 2.5a): \\vec{E}(\\vec{r}) = \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{1}{\\gr ^2} \\hat{\\gr} \\dd{q} If the charge is spread out along a line (Fig. 2.5b), with charge-per-unit-length \\lambda then \\dd{q} = \\lambda \\dd{l}' (where \\dd{l}' ) is an element of length along the line); if the charge is smeared out over a surface (Fig. 2.5c) with charge-per-unit-area \\sigma , then \\dd{q} = \\sigma \\dd{a}' (where \\dd{a'} ) is an element of area on the surface); and if the charge fills a volume (Fig 2.5d), with charge-per-unit-volume \\rho , then \\dd{q} = \\rho\\dd{\\tau'} (where \\dd{\\tau'} is an element of volume): dq \\rightarrow \\lambda \\dd{l'} \\sim \\sigma \\dd{a'} \\sim \\rho \\dd{\\tau'} Thus the electric field of a line charge is \\vec{E}(\\vec{r}) = \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\lambda(\\vec{r'})}{\\gr ^2} \\hat{\\gr} \\dd{l'} for a surface charge, \\vec{E}(\\vec{r}) = \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\sigma(\\vec{r'})}{\\gr ^2} \\hat{\\gr} \\dd{a'} and for a volume charge, \\vec{E}(\\vec{r}) = \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\int \\frac{\\rho(\\vec{r'})}{\\gr ^2} \\hat{\\gr} \\dd{\\tau'} \\label{2.8} Equation \\eqref{2.8} itself is often referred to as \"Coulomb's law,\" because it is such a short step from the original, and because a volume charge is in a sense the most general and realistic case. Please note carefully the meaning of \\gr in these formulas. Originally, in \\eqref{2.4} , \\gr_i stood for the vector from the source charge q_i to the field point r . Correspondingly, in Eq.s 9-11, \\gr is the vector from \\dd{q} to the field point \\vec{r} . Warning: the unit vector \\hat{\\gr} is not constant: its direction depends on the source point \\vec{r'} , and hence it cannot be taken outside the integrals (9-11). In practice, you must work with Cartesian components ( \\hat{x}, \\hat{y}, \\hat{z} are constant, and do come out) , even if you use curvilinear coordinates to perform the integration. 2.2: Divergence and Curl of Electrostatic Fields 2.2.1 Field Lines, Flux, and Gauss' Law In principle, we are done with the subject of electrostatics. Equation \\eqref{2.8} tells us how to compute the field of a charge distribution, and \\eqref{2.3} tells us what the force on a charge Q placed in this field will be. Unfortunately, as you may have discovered, the integrals involved in computing E can be formidable, even for reasonably simple charge distributions. Much of the rest of electrostatics is devoted to assembling a bag of tools and tricks for avoiding these integrals. It all begins with the divergence and curl of E . I shall calculate the divergence of E directly from \\eqref{2.8} in section 2.2.2, but first I want to show you a more qualitative, and perhaps more illuminating, intuitive approach. Let's begin with the simplest possible case: a single point charge q , situated at the origin: \\vec{E}(\\vec{r}) = \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{r^2} \\hat{\\vec{r}} To get a \"feel\" for this field, I might sketch a few representative vectors, as in Fig. 2.12a. Because the field falls off like 1/r^2 , the vectors get shorter as you go farther away from the origin; they always point radially outward. But there is a nicer way to represent this field, and that's to connect up the arrows, to form field lines (Fig. 2.12b). You might think that I have thereby thrown away information about the strength of the field, which was contained in the length of the arrows. But actually I have not. The magnitude of the field is indicated by the density of the field lines: it's strong near the center where the field lines are close together, and weak farther out, where they are relatively far apart. In truth, the field-line diagram is deceptive, when I draw it on a two-dimensional surface, for the density of lines passing through a circle of radius r is the total number divided by the circumference ( n / 2 \\pi r ), which goes like (1/r) , not (1/r^2) . But if you imagine the model in three dimensions (a pincushion with needles sticking out in all directions), then the density of lines is the total number divided by the area of the sphere (n/4 \\pi r^2) , which does go like (1/r^2) . Such diagrams are also convenient for representing more complicated fields. Of course, the number of lines you draw depends on how lazy you are (and how sharp your pencil is), though you ought to include enough to get an accurate sense of the field, and you must be consistent: if q gets 8 lines, then 2_q_ deserves 16. And you must space them fairly - they emanate from a point charge symmetrically in all directions. Field lines begin on positive charges and end on negative ones; they cannot simply terminate in midair, though they may extend out to infinity. Moreover, field lines can never cross - at the intersection the field would have two different directions at once! With all this in mind, it is easy to sketch the field of any simple configuration of point charges: Begin by drawing the lines in the neighborhood of each charge, and then connect them up or extend them to infinity (Figs. 2.13 and 2.14) In this model, the flux of E through a surface S, \\Phi_E \\equiv \\int _S \\vec{E} \\cdot \\dd{\\vec{a}} TODO: Finish Section 2.2! 2.3: Electric Potential 2.3.1: Introduction to Potential The electric field E is not just any old vector function. It is a very special kind of vector function: one whose curl id zero. \\vec{E} = y \\hat{x} , for example, could not possibly be an electrostatic field; no set of charges, regardless of their sizes and positions, could ever produce such a field. We're going to exploit this special property of electric fields to reduce a vector problem (finding E ) to a much simpler scalar problem. The first theorem in Sect 1.6.2 asserts that any vector whose curl is zero is equal to the gradient of some scalar. What I'm going to do now amounts to a proof of that claim, in the context of electrostatics. Because \\nabla \\cross \\vec{E} = 0 , the line integral of E around any closed loop is zero (that follows from Stokes' theorem). Because \\oint \\vec{E} \\cdot \\dd{\\vec{l}} = 0 , the line integral of E from point a to point b is the same for all paths (otherwise you could go out along path (i) and return along path (ii) - Fig 2.30 - and obtain \\oint \\vec{E} \\cdot \\dd{\\vec{l}} \\neq 0 ). Because the line integral is independent of path, we can define a function V(\\vec{r}) \\equiv - \\int _{O} ^{\\vec{r}} \\vec{E} \\cdot \\dd{\\vec{l}} \\label{2.21} Here O is some standard reference point on which we have agreed beforehand; V then depends only on the point \\vec{r} . It is called the electric potential . The potential difference between two points a and b is \\begin{align} V(\\vec{b}) - V(\\vec{a}) & = & -\\int_{O}^{\\vec{b}} \\vec{E}\\cdot \\dd{\\vec{l}} + \\int_{O}^{\\vec{a}} \\vec{E} \\cdot \\dd{\\vec{l}} \\\\ & = & -\\int_{O}^{\\vec{b}} \\vec{E}\\cdot \\dd{\\vec{l}} - \\int_{\\vec{a}}^{O} \\vec{E}\\cdot \\dd{\\vec{l}} \\\\ & = & - \\int_{\\vec{a}} ^{\\vec{b}} \\vec{E}\\cdot \\dd{\\vec{l}} \\end{align} Now, the fundamental theorem for gradients states that V(\\vec{b}) - V(\\vec{a}) = \\int_{\\vec{a}} ^{\\vec{b}} (\\grad{V}) \\cdot \\dd{\\vec{l}} so \\int_{\\vec{a}}^{\\vec{b}} (\\grad{V})\\cdot \\dd{\\vec{l}} = - \\int_{\\vec{a}}^{\\vec{b}} \\vec{E}\\cdot \\dd{\\vec{l}} Since, finally, this is true for any points a and b , the integrands must be equal: \\vec{E} = - \\grad{V} \\label{e-equals-grad-v} Equation \\eqref{e-equals-grad-v} is the differential version of \\eqref{2.21} ; it says that the electric field is the gradient of a scalar potential, which is what we set out to prove. Notice the subtle but crucial role played by path independence (or, equivalently, the fact that \\nabla \\times \\vec{E} = 0 ) in this argument. If the line integral of E depended on the path taken, then the \"definition\" of V \\eqref{2.21} would be nonsense. It simply would not define a function, since changing the path would alter the value of V(\\vec{r}) . By the way, don't let the minus sign in \\eqref{e-equals-grad-v} distract you; it carries over from \\eqref{2.21} and is largely a matter of convention. 2.3.2: Comments on Potential The name . The word \"potential\" is a hideous misnomer because it inevitably reminds you of potential energy . This is particularly insidious, because there is a connection between \"potential\" and \"potential energy,\" as you will see in Sect 2.4. I'm sorry that it is impossible to escape this word. The best I can do is to insist once and for all that \"potential\" and \"potential energy\" are completely different terms and should, by all rights, have different names. Incidentially, a surface over which the potential is constant is called an equipotential . Advantage of the potential formulation . If you know V, you can easily get E - just take the gradient: \\vec{E} =- \\grad{V} . This is quite extraordinary when you stop to think about it, for E is a vector quantity (three components), but V is a scalar (one component). How can one function possibly contain all the information that three independent functions carry? The answer is that the three components of E are not really as independent as they look; in fact, they are explicitly interrelated by the very condition we started with, \\nabla \\times \\vec{E} = 0 . In terms of components, \\pdv{E_x}{y} = \\pdv{E_y}{x}, \\qquad \\pdv{E_z}{y} = \\pdv{E_y}{z}, \\qquad \\pdv{E_x}{z} = \\pdv{E_z}{x} This brings us back to my observation at the beginning of Sect 2.3.1: E is a very special kind of vector.What the potential formulation does is to exploit this feature to maximum advantage, reducing a vector problem to a scalar one, in which there is no need to fuss with components. The reference point \\mathscr{O} . There is an essential ambiguity in the definition of potential, since the choice of reference point \\mathscr{O} was arbitrary. Changing reference points amounts to adding a constant K to the potential: V'(r) = -\\int_{\\mathscr{O}'}^{\\vec{r}} \\vec{E} \\cdot \\dd{\\vec{l}} \\\\ = - \\int_{\\mathscr{O}'} ^{\\mathscr{O}} \\vec{E} \\cdot \\dd{\\vec{l}} - \\int_{\\mathscr{O}}^{\\vec{r}} \\vec{E} \\cdot \\dd{\\vec{l}} \\\\ = K + V(\\vec{r}) where K is the line integral of E from the old reference point \\mathscr{O} to the new one \\mathscr{O}' . Of course, adding a constant to V will not affect the potential difference between two points, since the K's cancel out. Nor does the ambiguity affect the gradient of V: \\grad{V'} = \\grad{V} since the derivative of a constant is zero. That's why all such V's, differing only in their choice of reference point, correspond to the same field E Potential as such carries no real physical significance, for at any given point we can adjust its value at will by suitable relocation of \\mathscr{O} . In this sense, it is rather like altitude: if I ask you how high Denver is, you will probably tell me its height above sea level, because that is a convenient and traditional reference point. But we could as well agree to measure altitude above Washington, DC, or Greenwich, or wherever. That would add (or rather, subtract) a fixed amount from all our sea-level readings, but it wouldn't change anything about the real world. The only quantity of interest is the difference in altitude between two points, and that is the same whatever your reference level. Having said this, however, there is a \"natural\" spot to use for \\mathscr{O} in electrostatics - analogous to sea level for altitude - and that is a point infinitely far from the charge. Ordinarily, then, we s\"set the zero of potential at infinity.\" (Since V(\\mathscr{O}) = 0 , choosing a reference point is equivalent to selecting a place where V is to be zero.) But I must warn you that there is one special circumstance in which this convention fails: when the charge distribution itself extends to infinity. The symptom of trouble, in such cases, is that the potential blows up. For instance, the field of a uniformly charged plane is (\\sigma / 2 \\epsilon_0) \\hat{n} , as we found in Ex 2.5; if we naively put \\mathscr{O} = \\infty , then the potential at height z above the plane becomes V(z) = - \\int_{\\infty}^{z}\\frac{1}{2\\epsilon_0} \\sigma \\dd{z} = - \\frac{1}{2\\epsilon_0} \\sigma(z - \\infty) The remedy is simply to choose some other reference point (in this example you might use a point on the plane). Notice that the difficulty occurs only in textbook problems; in \"real life\" there is no such thing as a charge distribution that goes on forever, and we can always use infinity as our reference point. Potential obeys the superposition principle . The original superposition principle pertains to the force on a test charge Q. It says that the total force on Q is the vector sum of the forces attributable to the source charges individually: \\vec{F} = \\vec{F_1} + \\vec{F_2} + \\ldots Dividing through by Q, we see that the electric field, too, obeys the superposition principle: \\vec{E} = \\vec{E_1} + \\vec{E_2} + \\ldots Integrating from the common reference point to \\vec{r} , it follows that the potential also satisfies such a principle: V = V_1 + V_2 + \\ldots That is, the potential at any given point is the sum of the potentials due to all the source charges separately. Only this time it is an ordinary sum, not a vector sum, which makes it a lot easier to work with. Units of Potential . In our units, force is measured in newtons and charge in coulombs, so electric fields are in newtons per coulomb. Accordingly, potential is newton-meters per coulomb, or joules per coulomb. A joule per coulomb is a volt . 2.3.3: Poisson's Equation and Laplace's Equation We found in Sect 2.3.1 that the electric field can be written as the gradient of a scalar potential \\vec{E} = - \\grad{V} The question arises, what do the divergence and curl of E , \\div{\\vec{E}} = \\frac{\\rho}{\\epsilon_0} \\qquad \\text{ and } \\qquad \\curl{\\vec{E}} = 0 look like, in terms of V? Well, \\div{\\vec{E}} = \\div(-\\grad{V}) = -\\laplacian{V} , so, apart from that persistent minus sign, the divergence of E is the Laplacian of V. Gauss's law, then, says \\laplacian{V} = -\\frac{\\rho}{\\epsilon_0} This is known as Poisson's equation . In regions where there is no charge, so \\rho = 0 , Poisson's equation reduces to Laplace's equation, \\laplacian{V} = 0 We'll explore this equation more fully in Chapter 3. So much for Gauss's law. What about the curl law? This says that \\curl{\\vec{E}} = \\curl(-\\grad{V}) = 0 But that's no condition on V - curl of gradient is always zero. Of course, we used the curl law to show that E could be expressed as the gradient of a scalar, so it's not really surprising that this works out: \\curl{\\vec{E}} = 0 permits our definition of V; in return, \\vec{E} = - \\grad{V} guarantees \\curl{\\vec{E}} = 0 . It only takes one differential equation (Poisson's) to determine V, because V is a scalar. For \\vec{E} we needed two, the divergence and the curl. 2.3.4: The potential of a Localized Charge Distribution I defined V in terms of \\vec{E} \\eqref{2.21} . Ordinarily, though, it's E that we're looking for (if we already knew E , there wouldn't be much point in calculating V). The idea is that it might be easier to get V first, and then calculate E by taking the gradient. Typically, then, we know where the charge is (that is, we know \\rho ), and we want to find V. Now, Poisson's equation relates V and \\rho , but unfortunately it's \"the wrong way round\": it would give us \\rho if we knew V, whereas we want V, knowing \\rho . What we must do, then, is \"invert\" Poisson's equation. That's the program for this section, although I shall do it by roundabout means, beginning, as always, with a point charge at the origin. The electric field is \\vec{E} = (1 / 4 \\pi \\epsilon_0)(1 / r^2) \\hat{r} , and \\dd{\\vec{l}} = \\dd{r} \\hat{r} , and \\dd{\\vec{l}} = \\dd{r} \\hat{r} + r \\dd{\\theta} \\hat{\\theta} + r \\sin \\theta \\dd{\\theta} \\hat{\\phi} , so \\vec{E} \\cdot \\dd{\\vec{l}} = \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{r^2} \\dd{r} Setting the reference point at infinity, the potential of a point charge q at the origin is V(r) = - \\int_{\\mathscr{O}} ^r \\vec{E} \\cdot \\dd{\\vec{l}} \\\\ = \\frac{-1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\int_{\\infty}^r \\frac{q}{r' ^2} \\dd{r'} \\\\ = \\left.\\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{r'} \\right| ^r _{\\infty} = \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{r} (You see here the advantage of using infinity for the reference point: it kills the lower limit on the integral.) Notice the sign of V; presumably the conventional minus sign in the definition was chosen in order to make the potential of a positive charge come out positive.

The solution to this problem is facilitated by the principle of superposition, which states that the interaction between any two charges is completely unaffected by the presence of others. This means that to determine the force on Q, we can first compute the force \\vec{F_1} , due to q_1 alone (ignoring all the others); then we compute the force \\vec{F_2} , due to q_2 alone, and so in. Finally, we take the vector sum of all these individual forces: \\vec{F} = \\vec{F_1} + \\vec{F_2} + \\vec{F_3} + \\ldots Thus, if we can find the force on Q due to a single source charge q , we are, in principle, done (the rest is just a question of repeating the same operation over and over, and adding it all up) The principle of superposition may seem \"obvious\" to you, but it did not have to be so simple: if the electromagnetic force were proportional to the square of the total source charge, for instance, the principle of superposition would not hold, since (q_1 + q_2)^2 \\neq q_1 ^2 + q_2 ^2 (there would be \"cross terms\" to consider). Superposition is not a logical necessity, but an experimental fact. Well, at first sight this looks very easy: Why don't I just write down the formula for the force on Q due to q, and be done with it? I could , and in Chapter 10 I shall, but you would be shocked to see it at this stage, for not only does the force on Q depend on the separation distance \\gr between the charges (Fig 2.2), it also depends on both their velocities and on the acceleration of q . Moreover, it is not the position, velocity, and acceleration of q right now that matter: electromagnetic \"news\" travels at the speed of light, so what concerns Q is the position, velocity, and acceleration q had at some earlier time, when the message left. Therefore, in spite of the fact that the basic question (\"What is the force on Q due to q?\") is easy to state, it does not pay to confront it head on; rather, we shall go at it by stages. In the meantime, the theory we develop will allow for the solution of more subtle electromagnetic problems that do not present themselves in quite this simple format.

But I encourage you to think of the field as a \"real\" physical entity, filling the space around electric charges.

Equation \\eqref{2.8} tells us how to compute the field of a charge distribution, and \\eqref{2.3} tells us what the force on a charge Q placed in this field will be. Unfortunately, as you may have discovered, the integrals involved in computing E can be formidable, even for reasonably simple charge distributions. Much of the rest of electrostatics is devoted to assembling a bag of tools and tricks for avoiding these integrals. It all begins with the divergence and curl of E . I shall calculate the divergence of E directly from \\eqref{2.8} in section 2.2.2, but first I want to show you a more qualitative, and perhaps more illuminating, intuitive approach. Let's begin with the simplest possible case: a single point charge q , situated at the origin: \\vec{E}(\\vec{r}) = \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{r^2} \\hat{\\vec{r}} To get a \"feel\" for this field, I might sketch a few representative vectors, as in Fig. 2.12a. Because the field falls off like 1/r^2 , the vectors get shorter as you go farther away from the origin; they always point radially outward. But there is a nicer way to represent this field, and that's to connect up the arrows, to form field lines (Fig. 2.12b). You might think that I have thereby thrown away information about the strength of the field, which was contained in the length of the arrows. But actually I have not. The magnitude of the field is indicated by the density of the field lines: it's strong near the center where the field lines are close together, and weak farther out, where they are relatively far apart. In truth, the field-line diagram is deceptive, when I draw it on a two-dimensional surface, for the density of lines passing through a circle of radius r is the total number divided by the circumference ( n / 2 \\pi r ), which goes like (1/r) , not (1/r^2) . But if you imagine the model in three dimensions (a pincushion with needles sticking out in all directions), then the density of lines is the total number divided by the area of the sphere (n/4 \\pi r^2) , which does go like (1/r^2) . Such diagrams are also convenient for representing more complicated fields. Of course, the number of lines you draw depends on how lazy you are (and how sharp your pencil is), though you ought to include enough to get an accurate sense of the field, and you must be consistent: if q gets 8 lines, then 2_q_ deserves 16. And you must space them fairly - they emanate from a point charge symmetrically in all directions. Field lines begin on positive charges and end on negative ones; they cannot simply terminate in midair, though they may extend out to infinity. Moreover, field lines can never cross - at the intersection the field would have two different directions at once! With all this in mind, it is easy to sketch the field of any simple configuration of point charges: Begin by drawing the lines in the neighborhood of each charge, and then connect them up or extend them to infinity (Figs. 2.13 and 2.14) In this model, the flux of E through a surface S, \\Phi_E \\equiv \\int _S \\vec{E} \\cdot \\dd{\\vec{a}} TODO: Finish Section 2.2!","title":"2.2.1 Field Lines, Flux, and Gauss' Law"},{"location":"ch2/#23-electric-potential","text":"","title":"2.3: Electric Potential"},{"location":"ch2/#231-introduction-to-potential","text":"The electric field E is not just any old vector function.

We're going to exploit this special property of electric fields to reduce a vector problem (finding E ) to a much simpler scalar problem. The first theorem in Sect 1.6.2 asserts that any vector whose curl is zero is equal to the gradient of some scalar. What I'm going to do now amounts to a proof of that claim, in the context of electrostatics. Because \\nabla \\cross \\vec{E} = 0 , the line integral of E around any closed loop is zero (that follows from Stokes' theorem). Because \\oint \\vec{E} \\cdot \\dd{\\vec{l}} = 0 , the line integral of E from point a to point b is the same for all paths (otherwise you could go out along path (i) and return along path (ii) - Fig 2.30 - and obtain \\oint \\vec{E} \\cdot \\dd{\\vec{l}} \\neq 0 ).

The best I can do is to insist once and for all that \"potential\" and \"potential energy\" are completely different terms and should, by all rights, have different names. Incidentially, a surface over which the potential is constant is called an equipotential . Advantage of the potential formulation . If you know V, you can easily get E - just take the gradient: \\vec{E} =- \\grad{V} . This is quite extraordinary when you stop to think about it, for E is a vector quantity (three components), but V is a scalar (one component). How can one function possibly contain all the information that three independent functions carry? The answer is that the three components of E are not really as independent as they look; in fact, they are explicitly interrelated by the very condition we started with, \\nabla \\times \\vec{E} = 0 .

Of course, adding a constant to V will not affect the potential difference between two points, since the K's cancel out.

Ordinarily, though, it's E that we're looking for (if we already knew E , there wouldn't be much point in calculating V). The idea is that it might be easier to get V first, and then calculate E by taking the gradient. Typically, then, we know where the charge is (that is, we know \\rho ), and we want to find V. Now, Poisson's equation relates V and \\rho , but unfortunately it's \"the wrong way round\": it would give us \\rho if we knew V, whereas we want V, knowing \\rho . What we must do, then, is \"invert\" Poisson's equation. That's the program for this section, although I shall do it by roundabout means, beginning, as always, with a point charge at the origin. The electric field is \\vec{E} = (1 / 4 \\pi \\epsilon_0)(1 / r^2) \\hat{r} , and \\dd{\\vec{l}} = \\dd{r} \\hat{r} , and \\dd{\\vec{l}} = \\dd{r} \\hat{r} + r \\dd{\\theta} \\hat{\\theta} + r \\sin \\theta \\dd{\\theta} \\hat{\\phi} , so \\vec{E} \\cdot \\dd{\\vec{l}} = \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{r^2} \\dd{r} Setting the reference point at infinity, the potential of a point charge q at the origin is V(r) = - \\int_{\\mathscr{O}} ^r \\vec{E} \\cdot \\dd{\\vec{l}} \\\\ = \\frac{-1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\int_{\\infty}^r \\frac{q}{r' ^2} \\dd{r'} \\\\ = \\left.\\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{r'} \\right| ^r _{\\infty} = \\frac{1}{4 \\pi \\epsilon_0} \\frac{q}{r} (You see here the advantage of using infinity for the reference point: it kills the lower limit on the integral.) Notice the sign of V; presumably the conventional minus sign in the definition was chosen in order to make the potential of a positive charge come out positive. It is useful to remember that regions of positive charge are potential","title":"2.3.4: The potential of a Localized Charge Distribution"}]}
