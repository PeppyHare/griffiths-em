<h2 id="21-the-electric-field">2.1: The Electric Field</h2>
<h3 id="211-introduction">2.1.1: Introduction</h3>
<p>The fundamental problem electrodynamics hopes to solve is this (Fig 2.1): We have some electric charges <script type="math/tex"> q_1, q_2, q_3, \ldots </script> (call them <em>source charges</em>); what force do they exert on another charge, <script type="math/tex"> Q </script> (call it the <em>test charge</em>)? The positions of the source charges are given (as functions of time); the trajectory of the test particle is to be calculated. In general, both the source charges and the test charge are in motion.</p>
<p><img alt="Fig 2.1" src="../img/2.1.png" /></p>
<p>The solution to this problem is facilitated by the principle of superposition, which states that the interaction between any two charges is completely unaffected by the presence of others. This means that to determine the force on Q, we can first compute the force <script type="math/tex"> \vec{F_1} </script>, due to <script type="math/tex"> q_1 </script> alone (ignoring all the others); then we compute the force <script type="math/tex"> \vec{F_2} </script>, due to <script type="math/tex"> q_2 </script> alone, and so in. Finally, we take the vector sum of all these individual forces: <script type="math/tex"> \vec{F} = \vec{F_1} + \vec{F_2} + \vec{F_3} + \ldots </script> Thus, if we can find the force on Q due to a <em>single</em> source charge <script type="math/tex"> q </script>, we are, in principle, done (the rest is just a question of repeating the same operation over and over, and adding it all up)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The principle of superposition may seem "obvious" to you, but it did not have to be so simple: if the electromagnetic force were proportional to the <em>square</em> of the total source charge, for instance, the principle of superposition would not hold, since <script type="math/tex"> (q_1 + q_2)^2 \neq q_1 ^2 + q_2 ^2 </script> (there would be "cross terms" to consider). Superposition is not a logical necessity, but an experimental fact.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, at first sight this looks very easy: Why don't I just write down the formula for the force on Q due to q, and be done with it? I <em>could</em>, and in Chapter 10 I shall, but you would be shocked to see it at this stage, for not only does the force on Q depend on the separation distance <script type="math/tex"> \gr </script> between the charges (Fig 2.2), it also depends on both their velocities and on the acceleration of <script type="math/tex"> q </script>. Moreover, it is not the position, velocity, and acceleration of <script type="math/tex"> q </script>
<em>right now</em> that matter: electromagnetic "news" travels at the speed of light, so what concerns Q is the position, velocity, and acceleration q had at some earlier time, when the message left.</p>
<p>Therefore, in spite of the fact that the basic question ("What is the force on Q due to q?") is easy to state, it does not pay to confront it head on; rather, we shall go at it by stages. In the meantime, the theory we develop will allow for the solution of more subtle electromagnetic problems that do not present themselves in quite this simple format. To begin with, we shall consider the special case of <em>electrostatics</em> in which all the source charges are stationary (though the test charge may be moving).</p>
<h3 id="212-coulombs-law">2.1.2: Coulomb's Law</h3>
<p>What is the force on a test charge Q due to a single point charge q, that is at <em>rest</em> a distance <script type="math/tex"> \gr </script> away? The answer (based on experiments) is given by <em>Coulomb's Law</em>:</p>
<p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\vec{F} = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0}\frac{q Q}{\gr^2} \hat{\vec{\gr}}   \label{coulomblaw}
</script>
</p>
<p>The constant <script type="math/tex"> \epsilon_0 </script>  is called (ludicrously) the <em>permittivity of free space</em>. In SI units, where force is in newtons (N), distance in meters (m), and charge in coulombs (C), 
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\epsilon_0 = 8.85 \times 10^{-12} \frac{C^2}{N \cdot m ^2} 
</script>
</p>
<p>In words, the force is proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the separation distance. As always (Sect 1.1.4), <script type="math/tex"> \vec{\gr} </script> is the separation vector from <script type="math/tex"> \vec{r'} </script> (the location of q) to <script type="math/tex"> \vec{r} </script> (the location of Q): <script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\vec{\gr} = \vec{r} - \vec{r}'
</script>
</p>
<p>
<script type="math/tex"> \gr </script> is its magnitude, and <script type="math/tex"> \hat{\gr} </script> is its direction. The force points along the line from q to Q; it is repulsive if <em>q</em> and <em>Q</em> have the same sign, and attractive if their signs are opposite.</p>
<p>Coulomb's law and the principle of superposition constitute the physical input for electrostatics - the rest, except for some special properties of matter, is mathematical elaboration of these fundamental rules.</p>
<h3 id="213-the-electric-field">2.1.3: The Electric Field</h3>
<p>If we have <em>several</em> point charges <script type="math/tex"> q_1, q_2, \ldots , q_n </script>  at distances <script type="math/tex"> \gr_1 \gr_2 \ldots, \gr_n </script> from <em>Q</em>, the total force on <em>Q</em> is evidently
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\begin{align}
\vec{F} & = & \vec{F_1} + \vec{F_2} + \ldots \\
& = & \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \left( \frac{q_1 Q}{\gr_1 ^2} \hat{\gr}_1 + \frac{q_2 Q}{\gr_2 ^2} \hat{\gr}_2 + \ldots \right) \\
& = & \frac{Q}{4 \pi \epsilon _0} \left( \frac{q_1}{\gr ^2 _1} \hat{\gr_1} + \frac{q_2}{\gr _2 ^2}\hat{\gr_2} + \ldots \right) 
\end{align}
</script>
</p>
<p>or
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\vec{F} = Q \vec{E} \label{2.3}
</script>
</p>
<p>where 
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\vec{E}(\vec{r}) \equiv \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \sum_{i = 1}^n \frac{q_i}{\gr_{i}^2} \hat{\gr_i} \label{2.4}
</script>
</p>
<p><strong>E</strong> is called the <strong>electric field</strong> of the source charges. Notice that it is a function of position (<strong>r</strong>), because the separation vectors <script type="math/tex"> \gr_i </script> depend on the location of the field point P (Fig 2.3). But it makes no reference to the test charge Q. The electric field is a vector quantity that varies from point to point and is determined by the configuration of source charges; physically, <script type="math/tex"> \vec{E}(\vec{r}) </script> is the force per unit charge that would be exerted on a test charge, if you were to place one at P.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 2.3" src="../img/2.3.png" /></p>
<p>What exactly <em>is</em> an electric field? I have deliberately begun with what you might call the "minimal" interpretation of <strong>E</strong>, as an intermediate step in the calculation of electric forces. But I encourage you to think of the field as a "real" physical entity, filling the space around electric charges. Maxwell himself came to believe that electric and magnetic fields are stresses and strains in an invisible primordial jellylike "ether." Special relativity has forced us to abandon the notion of either, and with it Maxwell's mechanical interpretation of electromagnetic fields. (It is even possible, although cumbersome, to formulate classical electrodynamics as an "action-at-a-distance" theory, and dispense with the field concept altogether.) I can't tell you, then, what a field <em>is</em> -- only how to calculate it and what it can do for you once you've got it.</p>
<h3 id="214-continuous-charge-distributions">2.1.4: Continuous Charge Distributions</h3>
<p>Our definition of the electric field (Eq. <script type="math/tex"> \eqref{2.4} </script> ) assumes that the source of the field is a collection of discrete point charges <script type="math/tex"> q_i </script>. If, instead, the charge is distributed continuously over some region, the sum becomes an integral (Fig 2.5a):
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\vec{E}(\vec{r}) = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \int \frac{1}{\gr ^2} \hat{\gr} \dd{q}
</script>
</p>
<p>If the charge is spread out along a <em>line</em> (Fig. 2.5b), with charge-per-unit-length <script type="math/tex"> \lambda </script> then <script type="math/tex"> \dd{q} = \lambda \dd{l}' </script> (where <script type="math/tex"> \dd{l}' </script> ) is an element of length along the line); if the charge is smeared out over a surface (Fig. 2.5c) with charge-per-unit-area <script type="math/tex"> \sigma </script>, then <script type="math/tex"> \dd{q} = \sigma \dd{a}' </script>  (where <script type="math/tex"> \dd{a'} </script> ) is an element of area on the surface); and if the charge fills a <em>volume</em> (Fig 2.5d), with charge-per-unit-volume <script type="math/tex"> \rho </script>, then <script type="math/tex"> \dd{q} = \rho\dd{\tau'} </script> (where <script type="math/tex"> \dd{\tau'} </script> is an element of volume):
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
dq \rightarrow \lambda \dd{l'} \sim \sigma \dd{a'} \sim \rho \dd{\tau'}
</script>
</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 2.5" src="../img/2.5.png" /></p>
<p>Thus the electric field of a line charge is
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\vec{E}(\vec{r}) = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \int \frac{\lambda(\vec{r'})}{\gr ^2} \hat{\gr} \dd{l'}
</script>
for a surface charge,
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\vec{E}(\vec{r}) = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \int \frac{\sigma(\vec{r'})}{\gr ^2} \hat{\gr} \dd{a'}

and for a volume charge,
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\vec{E}(\vec{r}) = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \int \frac{\rho(\vec{r'})}{\gr ^2} \hat{\gr} \dd{\tau'} \label{2.8}
</script>
</p>
<p>Equation <script type="math/tex"> \eqref{2.8} </script> itself is often referred to as "Coulomb's law," because it is such a short step from the original, and because a volume charge is in a sense the most general and realistic case. Please note carefully the meaning of <script type="math/tex"> \gr </script> in these formulas. Originally, in <script type="math/tex"> \eqref{2.4} </script>, <script type="math/tex"> \gr_i </script> stood for the vector from the source charge <script type="math/tex"> q_i </script> to the field point <strong>r</strong>. Correspondingly, in Eq.s 9-11, <script type="math/tex"> \gr </script> is the vector from <script type="math/tex"> \dd{q} </script> to the field point <script type="math/tex"> \vec{r} </script>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Warning: the unit vector <script type="math/tex"> \hat{\gr} </script> is not constant: its direction depends on the source point <script type="math/tex"> \vec{r'} </script>, and hence it cannot be taken outside the integrals (9-11). In practice, you must work with Cartesian components (<script type="math/tex"> \hat{x}, \hat{y}, \hat{z} </script> are constant, and do come out) , even if you use curvilinear coordinates to perform the integration.</p>

<h3 id="221-field-lines-flux-and-gauss-law">2.2.1 Field Lines, Flux, and Gauss' Law</h3>
<p>In principle, we are <em>done</em> with the subject of electrostatics. Equation <script type="math/tex"> \eqref{2.8} </script> tells us how to compute the field of a charge distribution, and <script type="math/tex"> \eqref{2.3} </script> tells us what the force on a charge Q placed in this field will be. Unfortunately, as you may have discovered, the integrals involved in computing E can be formidable, even for reasonably simple charge distributions. Much of the rest of electrostatics is devoted to assembling a bag of tools and tricks for avoiding these integrals. It all begins with the divergence and curl of <strong>E</strong>. I shall calculate the divergence of <strong>E</strong> directly from <script type="math/tex"> \eqref{2.8} </script> in section 2.2.2, but first I want to show you a more qualitative, and perhaps more illuminating, intuitive approach.</p>
<p>Let's begin with the simplest possible case: a single point charge <em>q</em>, situated at the origin:
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\vec{E}(\vec{r}) = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{r^2} \hat{\vec{r}}
</script>
</p>
<p>To get a "feel" for this field, I might sketch a few representative vectors, as in Fig. 2.12a. Because the field falls off like <script type="math/tex"> 1/r^2 </script>, the vectors get shorter as you go farther away from the origin; they always point radially outward. But there is a nicer way to represent this field, and that's to connect up the arrows, to form <strong>field lines</strong> (Fig. 2.12b).</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 2.12" src="../img/2.12.png" /></p>
<p>You might think that I have thereby thrown away information about the <em>strength</em> of the field, which was contained in the length of the arrows. But actually I have not. The magnitude of the field is indicated by the <em>density</em> of the field lines: it's strong near the center where the field lines are close together, and weak farther out, where they are relatively far apart.</p>
<p>In truth, the field-line diagram is deceptive, when I draw it on a two-dimensional surface, for the density of lines passing through a circle of radius <em>r</em> is the total number divided by the circumference (<script type="math/tex"> n / 2 \pi r </script>), which goes like <script type="math/tex"> (1/r) </script>, not <script type="math/tex"> (1/r^2) </script>. But if you imagine the model in three dimensions (a pincushion with needles sticking out in all directions), then the density of lines is the total number divided by the area of the sphere <script type="math/tex"> (n/4 \pi r^2) </script>, which <em>does</em> go like <script type="math/tex"> (1/r^2) </script>.</p>
<p>Such diagrams are also convenient for representing more complicated fields. Of course, the number of lines you draw depends on how lazy you are (and how sharp your pencil is), though you ought to include enough to get an accurate sense of the field, and you must be consistent: if <script type="math/tex"> q </script>  gets 8 lines, then <script type="math/tex"> 2q </script>  deserves 16. And you must space them fairly - they emanate from a point charge symmetrically in all directions. Field lines begin on positive charges and end on negative ones; they cannot simply terminate in midair, though they may extend out to infinity. Moreover, field lines can never cross - at the intersection the field would have two different directions at once! With all this in mind, it is easy to sketch the field of any simple configuration of point charges: Begin by drawing the lines in the neighborhood of each charge, and then connect them up or extend them to infinity (Figs. 2.13 and 2.14)</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 2.13" src="../img/2.13.png" />
<img alt="Figure 2.14" src="../img/2.14.png" /></p>
<p>In this model, the <em>flux</em> of <strong>E</strong> through a surface S,
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\Phi_E \equiv \int _S \vec{E} \cdot \dd{\vec{a}} \label{2.11}
</script>
</p>
<p>is a measure of the "number of lines" passing through S. I put this in quotes because of course we can only draw a representative <em>sample</em> of field lines - the total number would be infinite. But for a given sampling rate the flux is <em>proportional</em> to the number of lines drawn, because the field strength, remember, is proportional to the density of field lines (the number per unit area), and hence <script type="math/tex"> \vec{E} \cdot \dd{\vec{a}} </script> is proportional to the number of lines passing through the infinitesimal area <script type="math/tex"> \dd{\vec{a}} </script>. (The dot product picks out the component of <script type="math/tex"> \dd{\vec{a}} </script> along the direction of <strong>E</strong>, as indicated in Fig 2.15. It is the area in the plane perpendicular to <strong>E</strong> that we have in mind when we say that the density of field lines is the number per unit area).</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 2.15" src="../img/2.15.png" />
<img alt="Figure 2.16" src="../img/2.16.png" /></p>
<p>This suggests that the flux through any <em>closed</em> surface is a measure of the total charge inside. For the field lines that originate on a positive charge must either pass out through the surface or else terminate on a negative charge inside (Fig 2.16a). On the other hand, a charge <em>outside</em> the surface will contribute nothing to the total flux, since its field lines pass in one side and out the other (Fig 2.16b). This is the <em>essence</em> of Gauss's law. Now let's make it quantitative.</p>
<p>In the case of a point charge <em>q</em> at the origin, the flux of <strong>E</strong> through a spherical surface or radius <em>r</em> is
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\oint \vec{E} \cdot \dd{\vec{a}} = \int \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \left( \frac{q}{r^2} \hat{r} \right) \cdot \left( r^2 \sin \theta \dd{\theta} \dd{\phi} \hat{r} \right) = \frac{1}{\epsilon_0} q \label{2.12}
</script>
</p>
<p>Notice that the radius of the sphere cancels out, for while the surface area goes <em>up</em> as <script type="math/tex"> r^2 </script>, the field goes <em>down</em> as <script type="math/tex"> 1/r^2 </script>, so the product is constant. In terms of the field-line picture, this makes good sense, since the same number of field lines pass through any sphere centered at the origin, regardless of its size. In fact, it didn't have to be a sphere - any closed surface, whatever its shape, would be pierced by the same number of field lines. Evidently, the flux through any surface enclosing the charge is <script type="math/tex"> q / \epsilon_0 </script>.</p>
<p>Now suppose that instead of a single charge at the origin, we have a bunch of charges scattered about. According to the principle of superposition, the total field is the (vector) sum of all the individual fields:
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\vec{E} = \sum _{i = 1} ^\nu \vec{E}_i
</script>
</p>
<p>The flux through a surface that encloses them all is
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\oint \vec{E} \cdot \dd{\vec{l}} = \sum _{i = 1}^n \left( \oint \vec{E_i} \cdot \dd{\vec{a}} \right) = \sum_{i = 1}^n \left( \frac{1}{\epsilon_0} q_i  \right)
</script>
</p>
<p>For any closed surface, then
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\oint \vec{E} \cdot \dd{\vec{a}} = \frac{1}{\epsilon_0} Q_{enc} \label{2.13}
</script>
</p>
<p>where <script type="math/tex"> Q_{enc} </script> is the total charge enclosed within the surface. This is the quantitative statement of Gauss's law. Although it contains no information that was not already present in Coulomb's law plus the principle of superposition, it is of almost magical power, as you will see in Sect. 2.2.3. Notice that it all hinges on the <script type="math/tex"> 1/r^2 </script> character of Coulomb's law; without that, the crucial cancellation of the <em>r</em>'s in <script type="math/tex"> \eqref{2.12} </script> would not take place, and the total flux of <strong>E</strong> would depend on the surface chosen, not merely on the total charge enclosed. Other <script type="math/tex"> 1/r^2 </script> forces (I am thinking particularly of Newton's law of universal gravitation) will obey "Gauss's laws" of their own, and the applications we develop here carry over directly.</p>
<p>As it stands, Gauss's law is an <em>integral</em> equation, but we can easily turn it into a differential one by applying the divergence theorem:
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\oint_{S} \vec{E} \cdot \dd{\vec{a}} = \int_{\mathscr{V}} (\div{\vec{E}}) \dd{\tau}
</script>
Rewriting <script type="math/tex"> Q_{enc} </script> in terms of the charge density <script type="math/tex"> \rho </script> we have
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
Q_{enc} = \int_{\mathscr{V}} \rho \dd{\tau}
</script>
So Gauss's law becomes
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\int_{\mathscr{V}} (\div{\vec{E}}) \dd{\tau} = \int_{\mathscr{V}} \left( \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0} \dd{\tau} \right)
</script>
And since this holds for <em>any</em> volume, the integrands must be equal:
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\nabla \cdot \vec{E} = \frac{1}{\epsilon_0} \rho \label{2.14}
</script>
</p>
<p>Equation <script type="math/tex"> \eqref{2.14} </script> carries the same message as <script type="math/tex"> \eqref{2.13} </script>; it is <strong>Gauss's law in differential form</strong>. The differential version is tidier, but the integral form has the advantage that it accommodates point, line, and surface charges more naturally.</p>
<h3 id="222-the-divergence-of-e">2.2.2: The Divergence of E</h3>
<p>Let's go back now, and calculate the divergence of <script type="math/tex"> \vec{E} </script> directly from <script type="math/tex"> \eqref{2.8} </script>:
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\vec{E}(\vec{r}) = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \int_{\text{all space}} \frac{\hat{\gr}}{\gr ^2} \rho(\vec{r}') \dd{\tau'} \label{2.15}
</script>
</p>
<p>(Originally the integration was over the volume occupied by the charge, but I may as well extend it to all space, since <script type="math/tex"> \rho = 0 </script> in the exterior region anyway.) Noting that the r-dependence is contained in <script type="math/tex"> \gr = r - r' </script>, we have
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\div{\vec{E}} = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \int \vec{\nabla} \cdot \left( \frac{\hat{\gr}}{\gr^2}  \right) \rho(\vec{r'}) \dd{\tau'} 
</script>
We calculated this divergence in Section 1.5:
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\div{\left( \frac{\hat{\gr}}{\gr^2}  \right)} = 4 \pi \delta ^3(\gr)
</script>
Thus
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\div{\vec{E}} = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \int 4 \pi \delta^3(\vec{r} - \vec{r'}) \rho(\vec{r'}) \dd{\tau'} = \frac{1}{\epsilon_0} \rho(\vec{r}) \label{2.16}
</script>
which is Gauss's law in differential form <script type="math/tex"> \eqref{2.14} </script>. To recover the integral form <script type="math/tex"> \eqref{2.13} </script> we run the previous argument in reverse - integrate over a volume and apply the divergence theorem:
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\int_{\mathscr{V}} \div{\vec{E}} \dd{\tau} = \oint_{\mathscr{S}} \vec{E} \cdot \dd{\vec{a}} = \frac{1}{\epsilon_0} \int_{\mathscr{V}} \rho \dd{\tau} = \frac{1}{\epsilon_0} Q_{enc}
</script>
</p>
<h3 id="223-applications-of-gausss-law">2.2.3: Applications of Gauss's Law</h3>
<p>I must interrupt the theoretical development at this point to show you the extraordinary power of Gauss's law, in integral form. When symmetry permits, it affords <em>by far</em> the quickest and easiest way of computing electric fields. I'll illustrate the method with a series of examples.</p>
<hr />
<h4 id="example-23">Example 2.3</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Find the field outside a uniformly charged solid sphere of radius R and total charge q</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>
Imagine a spherical surface at radius <script type="math/tex"> r > R </script> (Fig. 2.18). This is called a <strong>Gaussian surface</strong> in the trade. Gauss's law says that
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\oint_{\mathscr{S}} \vec{E} \cdot \dd{\vec{a}} = \frac{1}{\epsilon_0} Q_{enc}
</script>
and in this case <script type="math/tex"> Q_{enc} = q </script>. At first glance this doesn't seem to get us very far, because the quantity we want (E) is buried inside the surface integral. Luckily, symmetry allows us to extract E from under the integral sign: <strong>E</strong> certainly points radially outward, as does <script type="math/tex"> \dd{\vec{a}} </script>, so we can drop the dot product
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\int_{\mathscr{S}} \vec{E} \cdot \dd{\vec{a}} = \int_{\mathscr{S}} | \vec{E} | da
</script>
</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 2.18" src="../img/2.18.png" /></p>
<p>and the magnitude of E is constant over the Gaussian surface, so it comes outside the integral:
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\int_{S} | E | da = |E| \int_{S} da = E 4 \pi r^2
</script>
Thus
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
|\vec{E}|4\pi r^2 = \frac{1}{\epsilon_0} q
</script>
or
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\vec{E} = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{r^2} \hat{r}
</script>
</p>
<p>Notice a remarkable feature of this result: the field outside the sphere is exactly the same as it would have been if all the charge had been concentrated at the center.</p>
<hr />
<p>Gauss's law is always <em>true</em>, but not always <em>useful</em>. If <script type="math/tex"> \rho </script> had not been uniform (or at any rate, not spherically symmetrical), or if I had chosen some other shape for my Gaussian surface, it would have still been true that the flux of <script type="math/tex"> \vec{E} </script> is <script type="math/tex"> q / \epsilon_0 </script>, but <script type="math/tex"> \vec{E} </script> would not have pointed in the same direction as <script type="math/tex"> \dd{\vec{a}} </script>, and its magnitude would not have been constant over the surface, and without that I cannot get <script type="math/tex"> |\vec{E}| </script> outside the integral. Symmetry is crucial to this application of Gauss's law. As far as I know, there are only three kinds of symmetry that work:</p>
<ol>
<li>Spherical symmetry. Make your Gaussian survace a concentric sphere.</li>
<li>Cylindrical symmetry. Make your Gaussian surface a coaxial cylinder.</li>
<li>Plane symmetry. Use a Gaussian "pillbox" that straddles the surface.</li>
</ol>
<p>Although 2 and 3 technically require infinitely long cylinders, and planes extending to infinity, we shall often use them to get approximate answers for "long" cylinders or "large" planes, at points far from the edges.</p>
<hr />
<h4 id="example-24">Example 2.4</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>A long cylinder (Fig 2.21) carries a charge density that is proportional to the distance from the axis: <script type="math/tex"> \rho = ks </script> for some constant <script type="math/tex"> k </script>. Find the electric field inside this cylinder.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Figure 2.21" src="../img/2.21.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Draw a Gaussian cylinder of length l and radius s. For this surface, Gauss's law states
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\oint_{\mathscr{S}} \vec{E} \cdot \dd{\vec{a}} = \frac{1}{\epsilon_0} Q_{enc}
</script>
</p>
<p>The enclosed charge is
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\begin{align}
Q_{enc} & = & \int \rho \dd{\tau} \\
& = & \int(ks')(s' \dd{s'} \dd{\phi} \dd{z}) \\
& = & 2 \pi k l \int_{0}^{s} s'^2 \dd{s'} \\
& = & \frac{2}{3} \pi k l s^3
\end{align}
</script>
</p>
<p>(I used the volume element appropriate to cylindrical coordinates, and integrated <script type="math/tex"> \phi </script> from <script type="math/tex"> 0 </script> to <script type="math/tex"> 2\pi </script>, <script type="math/tex"> \dd{z} </script> from <script type="math/tex"> 0 </script> to <script type="math/tex"> l </script>. I put a prime on the integration variable <script type="math/tex"> s' </script> to distinguish it from the radius <script type="math/tex"> s </script> of the Gaussian surface.)</p>
<p>Now, symmetry dictates that <script type="math/tex"> \vec{E} </script> must point radially outward, so for the curved portion of the Gaussian cylinder we have:
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\int \vec{E} \cdot \dd{\vec{a}} = \int | \vec{E}| da = | \vec{E}| \int da = |\vec{E} 2 \pi s l
</script>
while the two ends contribute nothing (here <script type="math/tex"> \vec{E} </script> is perpendicular to <script type="math/tex"> \dd{\vec{a}} </script>). Thus,
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
|\vec{E} | 2 \pi s l = \frac{1}{\epsilon_0} \frac{2}{3} \pi k l s^3
</script>
or, finally,
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\vec{E} = \frac{1}{3\epsilon_0} k s^2 \hat{s}
</script>
</p>
<hr />
<h4 id="example-25">Example 2.5</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>An infinite plane carries a uniform surface charge <script type="math/tex"> \sigma </script>. Find its electric field.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>
Draw a Gaussian pillbox, extending equal distances above and below the plane (Fig. 2.22). Apply Gauss's law to this surface:
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\oint \vec{E} \cdot \dd{\vec{a}} = \frac{1}{\epsilon_0} Q_{enc}
</script>
</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 2.22" src="../img/2.22.png" /></p>
<p>In this case, <script type="math/tex"> Q = \sigma A </script>, where A is the area of the lid of the pillbox. By symmetry, <script type="math/tex"> \vec{E} </script> points away from the plane (upward for points above, downward for points below). So the top and bottom surfaces yield
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\int \vec{E} \cdot \dd{\vec{a}} = 2 A |\vec{E}|,
</script>
whereas the sides contribute nothing. Thus
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
2 A | \vec{E} | = \frac{1}{\epsilon_0} \sigma A 
</script>
</p>
<p>or
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\vec{E} = \frac{\sigma}{2 \epsilon_0} \hat{n}
</script>
</p>
<p>where <script type="math/tex"> \hat{n} </script> is a unit vector pointing away from the surface. In Prob 2.6, you obtained this same result by a much more laborious method.</p>
<p>It seems surprising, at first, that the field of an infinite plane is <em>independent of how fara away you are</em>. What about the <script type="math/tex"> 1/r^2 </script> in Coulomb's law? The point is that as you move farther and farther away from the plane, more and more charge comes into your "field of view," and this compensates for the diminishing influence of any particular piece. The electric field of a sphere falls off like <script type="math/tex"> 1/r^2 </script>; the electric field of an infinite line falls off like <script type="math/tex"> 1/r </script>; and the electric field of an infinite plane does not fall off at all (you cannot escape from an infinite plane).</p>
<p>Although the direct use of Gauss's law to compute fields is limited to cases of spherical, cylindrical, and planar symmetry, we can put together combinations of objects posessing such symmetry, even though the arrangement as a whole is not symmetrical. For example, invoking the principle of superposition, we could find the field in the vicinity of two uniformly charged parallel cylinders, or a sphere near an infinite charged plane.</p>
<hr />
<h4 id="example-26">Example 2.6</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Two infinite parallel planes carry equal but opposite uniform charge densities <script type="math/tex"> \pm \sigma </script> (Fig 2.23). Find the field in each of the three regions: (i) to the left of both, (ii) between them, (iii) to the right of both.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Figure 2.23" src="../img/2.23.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>The left plate produces a field <script type="math/tex"> (1/2 \epsilon_0)\sigma </script>, which points away from it (Fig. 2.24) to the left in region in (i) and to the right in regions (ii) and (iii). The right plate, being negatively charged, produces a field <script type="math/tex"> (1/2 \epsilon_0)\sigma </script> which points <em>toward</em> it - to the right in regions (i) and (ii) and to the left in region (iii). The two fields cancel in regions (i) and (iii); they conspire in region (ii). Conclusion: The field between the plates is <script type="math/tex"> \sigma / \epsilon_0 </script>, and points to the right; elsewhere it is zero.</p>
<h3 id="224-the-curl-of-e">2.2.4: The Curl of E</h3>
<p>I'll calculate the curl of <script type="math/tex"> \vec{E} </script> as I did the divergence in Sect 2.2.1, by studying first the simplest possible configuration: a point charge at the origin. In this case
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
  \vec{E} = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{r^2} \hat{r} 
  </script>
<br />
Now, a glance at Fig 2.12 should convince you that the curl of this field has to be zero, but I suppose we ought to come up with something a little more rigorous than that. What if we calculate the line integral of this field from some point <script type="math/tex"> \vec{a} </script> to some other point <script type="math/tex"> \vec{b} </script> (Fig 2.29):
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\int_{\vec{a}}^{\vec{b}} \vec{E} \cdot \dd{\vec{l}}
</script>
</p>
<p>In spherical coordinates, <script type="math/tex"> \dd{\vec{l}} = \dd{r} \hat{r} + r \dd{\theta} \hat{\theta} + r \sin \theta \dd{\phi} \hat{\phi} </script>, so 
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\vec{E} \cdot \dd{\vec{l}} = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{1}{r^2} \dd{r}
</script>
</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 2.29" src="../img/2.29.png" /></p>
<p>Therefore,
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\int_{\vec{a}}^{\vec{b}} \vec{E} \cdot \dd{\vec{l}} = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \int_{a}^{b} \frac{q}{r^2} \dd{r} \\ 
= \left.\frac{-1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{r} \right|_{r_a} ^{r_b} \\
= \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \left( \frac{q}{r_a} - \frac{q}{r_b}  \right)
</script>
The integral around a <em>closed</em> path is evidently zero (for then <script type="math/tex"> r_a = r_b </script> ):
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\oint \vec{E} \cdot \dd\vec{l} = 0 \label{2.19}
</script>
and hence, applying Stokes' theorem
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\curl{\vec{E}} = 0 \label{2.20}
</script>
</p>
<p>Now, I proved eqs. <script type="math/tex"> \eqref{2.19} </script> and <script type="math/tex"> \eqref{2.20} </script> only for the field of a single point charge at the origin, but these results make no reference to what is, after all, a perfectly arbitrary choice of coordinates; they hold no matter where the charge is located. Moreover, if we have many charges, the principle of superposition states that the total field is a vector sum of their individual fields:
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
 \vec{E} = \vec{E_1} + \vec{E_2} + \ldots
 </script> 
so
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\curl{\vec{E}} = \curl{(\vec{E_1} + \vec{E_2} + \ldots)} = (\curl{\vec{E_1}}) + (\curl{\vec{E_2}}) + \ldots = 0
</script>
</p>
<p>Thus, Eqs.  <script type="math/tex"> \eqref{2.19} </script> and <script type="math/tex"> \eqref{2.20} </script> hold for any <em>static</em> charge distribution whatever.</p>

<p>The electric field <strong>E</strong> is not just <em>any</em> old vector function. It is a very special <em>kind</em> of vector function: one whose curl id zero. <script type="math/tex"> \vec{E} = y \hat{x} </script> , for example, could not possibly be an electrostatic field; <em>no</em> set of charges, regardless of their sizes and positions, could ever produce such a field. We're going to exploit this special property of electric fields to reduce a <em>vector</em> problem (finding <strong>E</strong>) to a much simpler <em>scalar</em> problem. The first theorem in Sect 1.6.2 asserts that any vector whose curl is zero is equal to the gradient of some scalar. What I'm going to do now amounts to a proof of that claim, in the context of electrostatics.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 2.30" src="../img/2.30.png" /></p>
<p>Because <script type="math/tex"> \nabla \cross \vec{E} = 0</script> , the line integral of <strong>E</strong> around any closed loop is zero (that follows from Stokes' theorem). Because <script type="math/tex"> \oint \vec{E} \cdot \dd{\vec{l}} = 0 </script>, the line integral of <strong>E</strong> from point <strong>a</strong> to point <strong>b</strong> is the same for all paths (otherwise you could go <em>out</em> along path (i) and return along path (ii) - Fig 2.30 - and obtain <script type="math/tex"> \oint \vec{E} \cdot \dd{\vec{l}} \neq 0 </script> ). Because the line integral is independent of path, we can define a function
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
V(\vec{r}) \equiv - \int _{O} ^{\vec{r}} \vec{E} \cdot \dd{\vec{l}} \label{2.21}
</script>
</p>
<p>Here <script type="math/tex"> O </script> is some standard reference point on which we have agreed beforehand; V then depends only on the point <script type="math/tex"> \vec{r} </script>. It is called the <strong>electric potential</strong>.</p>
<p>The potential <em>difference</em> between two points <strong>a</strong> and <strong>b</strong> is
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\begin{align}
V(\vec{b}) - V(\vec{a}) & = & -\int_{O}^{\vec{b}} \vec{E}\cdot \dd{\vec{l}} + \int_{O}^{\vec{a}} \vec{E} \cdot \dd{\vec{l}} \\
& = & -\int_{O}^{\vec{b}} \vec{E}\cdot \dd{\vec{l}} - \int_{\vec{a}}^{O} \vec{E}\cdot \dd{\vec{l}} \\
& = & - \int_{\vec{a}} ^{\vec{b}} \vec{E}\cdot \dd{\vec{l}}
\end{align}
</script>
</p>
<p>Now, the fundamental theorem for gradients states that
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
V(\vec{b}) - V(\vec{a}) = \int_{\vec{a}} ^{\vec{b}} (\grad{V}) \cdot \dd{\vec{l}}
</script>
so
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\int_{\vec{a}}^{\vec{b}} (\grad{V})\cdot \dd{\vec{l}} = - \int_{\vec{a}}^{\vec{b}} \vec{E}\cdot \dd{\vec{l}}
</script>
Since, finally, this is true for <em>any</em> points <strong>a</strong> and <strong>b</strong>, the integrands must be equal:
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\vec{E} = - \grad{V} \label{e-equals-grad-v}
</script>
</p>
<p>Equation <script type="math/tex"> \eqref{e-equals-grad-v} </script> is the differential version of <script type="math/tex"> \eqref{2.21} </script>; it says that the electric field is the gradient of a scalar potential, which is what we set out to prove.</p>
<p>Notice the subtle but crucial role played by path independence (or, equivalently, the fact that <script type="math/tex"> \nabla \times \vec{E} = 0 </script> ) in this argument. If the line integral of <strong>E</strong> depended on the path taken, then the "definition" of V <script type="math/tex"> \eqref{2.21} </script> would be nonsense. It simply would not define a function, since changing the path would alter the value of <script type="math/tex"> V(\vec{r}) </script>. By the way, don't let the minus sign in <script type="math/tex"> \eqref{e-equals-grad-v} </script> distract you; it carries over from <script type="math/tex"> \eqref{2.21} </script> and is largely a matter of convention.</p>
<h3 id="232-comments-on-potential">2.3.2: Comments on Potential</h3>
<p><strong>The name</strong>. The word "potential" is a hideous misnomer because it inevitably reminds you of potential <em>energy</em>. This is particularly insidious, because there <em>is</em> a connection between "potential" and "potential energy," as you will see in Sect 2.4. I'm sorry that it is impossible to escape this word. The best I can do is to insist once and for all that "potential" and "potential energy" are completely different terms and should, by all rights, have different names. Incidentially, a surface over which the potential is constant is called an <strong>equipotential</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Advantage of the potential formulation</strong>. If you know V, you can easily get <strong>E</strong> - just take the gradient: <script type="math/tex"> \vec{E} =- \grad{V} </script>. This is quite extraordinary when you stop to think about it, for <strong>E</strong> is a <em>vector</em> quantity (three components), but V is a <strong>scalar</strong> (one component). How can one function possibly contain all the information that three independent functions carry? The answer is that the three components of <strong>E</strong> are not really as independent as they look; in fact, they are explicitly interrelated by the very condition we started with,<script type="math/tex"> \nabla \times \vec{E} = 0 </script>. In terms of components,
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\pdv{E_x}{y} = \pdv{E_y}{x}, \qquad \pdv{E_z}{y} = \pdv{E_y}{z}, \qquad \pdv{E_x}{z} = \pdv{E_z}{x}
</script>
</p>
<p>This brings us back to my observation at the beginning of Sect 2.3.1: <strong>E</strong> is a very special kind of vector.What the potential formulation does is to exploit this feature to maximum advantage, reducing a vector problem to a scalar one, in which there is no need to fuss with components.</p>
<p><strong>The reference point <script type="math/tex"> \mathscr{O} </script></strong>. There is an essential ambiguity in the definition of potential, since the choice of reference point <script type="math/tex"> \mathscr{O} </script> was arbitrary. Changing reference points amounts to adding a constant K to the potential:
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
V'(r) =  -\int_{\mathscr{O}'}^{\vec{r}} \vec{E} \cdot \dd{\vec{l}} \\ 
= - \int_{\mathscr{O}'} ^{\mathscr{O}} \vec{E} \cdot \dd{\vec{l}} - \int_{\mathscr{O}}^{\vec{r}} \vec{E} \cdot \dd{\vec{l}} \\
=  K + V(\vec{r})
</script>
</p>
<p>where K is the line integral of <strong>E</strong> from the old reference point <script type="math/tex"> \mathscr{O} </script> to the new one <script type="math/tex"> \mathscr{O}' </script>. Of course, adding a constant to V will not affect the potential <em>difference</em> between two points, since the K's cancel out. Nor does the ambiguity affect the gradient of V:
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\grad{V'} = \grad{V} 
</script>
since the derivative of a constant is zero. That's why all such V's, differing only in their choice of reference point, correspond to the same field <strong>E</strong></p>
<p>Potential as such carries no real physical significance, for at any given point we can adjust its value at will by suitable relocation of <script type="math/tex"> \mathscr{O} </script>. In this sense, it is rather like altitude: if I ask you how high Denver is, you will probably tell me its height above sea level, because that is a convenient and traditional reference point. But we could as well agree to measure altitude above Washington, DC, or Greenwich, or wherever. That would add (or rather, subtract) a fixed amount from all our sea-level readings, but it wouldn't change anything about the real world. The only quantity of interest is the <em>difference</em> in altitude between two points, and that is the same whatever your reference level.</p>
<p>Having said this, however, there is a "natural" spot to use for <script type="math/tex"> \mathscr{O} </script> in electrostatics - analogous to sea level for altitude - and that is a point infinitely far from the charge. Ordinarily, then, we s"set the zero of potential at infinity." (Since <script type="math/tex"> V(\mathscr{O}) = 0 </script>, choosing a reference point is equivalent to selecting a place where <script type="math/tex"> V </script> is to be zero.) But I must warn you that there is one special circumstance in which this convention fails: when the charge distribution itself extends to infinity. The symptom of trouble, in such cases, is that the potential blows up. For instance, the field of a uniformly charged plane is <script type="math/tex"> (\sigma / 2 \epsilon_0) \hat{n} </script>, as we found in Ex 2.5; if we naively put <script type="math/tex"> \mathscr{O} = \infty </script>, then the potential at height <em>z</em> above the plane becomes
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
V(z) = - \int_{\infty}^{z}\frac{1}{2\epsilon_0} \sigma \dd{z} = - \frac{1}{2\epsilon_0} \sigma(z - \infty)
</script> 
The remedy is simply to choose some other reference point (in this example you might use a point on the plane). Notice that the difficulty occurs only in textbook problems; in "real life" there is no such thing as a charge distribution that goes on forever, and we can <em>always</em> use infinity as our reference point.</p>
<p><strong>Potential obeys the superposition principle</strong>. The original superposition principle pertains to the force on a test charge Q. It says that the total force on <em>Q</em> is the vector sum of the forces attributable to the source charges individually:
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\vec{F} = \vec{F_1} + \vec{F_2} + \ldots
</script>
Dividing through by Q, we see that the electric field, too, obeys the superposition principle:
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\vec{E} = \vec{E_1} + \vec{E_2} + \ldots \label{2.38}
</script>
Integrating from the common reference point to <script type="math/tex"> \vec{r} </script>, it follows that the potential also satisfies such a principle:
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
V = V_1 + V_2 + \ldots
</script>
That is, the potential at any given point is the sum of the potentials due to all the source charges separately. Only this time it is an <em>ordinary</em> sum, not a vector sum, which makes it a lot easier to work with.</p>
<p><strong>Units of Potential</strong>. In our units, force is measured in newtons and charge in coulombs, so electric fields are in newtons per coulomb. Accordingly, potential is newton-meters per coulomb, or joules per coulomb. A joule per coulomb is a <strong>volt</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="233-poissons-equation-and-laplaces-equation">2.3.3: Poisson's Equation and Laplace's Equation</h3>
<p>We found in Sect 2.3.1 that the electric field can be written as the gradient of a scalar potential
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\vec{E} = - \grad{V}
</script>
The question arises, what do the divergence and curl of <strong>E</strong>,
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\div{\vec{E}} = \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0} \qquad \text{ and } \qquad \curl{\vec{E}} = 0
</script>
look like, in terms of V? Well, <script type="math/tex"> \div{\vec{E}} = \div(-\grad{V}) = -\laplacian{V} </script>, so, apart from that persistent minus sign, the divergence of <strong>E</strong> is the Laplacian of V. Gauss's law, then, says
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\laplacian{V} = -\frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0} \label{2.24}
</script>
</p>
<p>This is known as <strong>Poisson's equation</strong>. In regions where there is no charge, so <script type="math/tex"> \rho = 0 </script>, Poisson's equation reduces to Laplace's equation,
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\laplacian{V} = 0 \label{2.25}
</script>
</p>
<p>We'll explore this equation more fully in Chapter 3.</p>
<p>So much for Gauss's law. What about the curl law? This says that
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\curl{\vec{E}} = \curl(-\grad{V}) = 0
</script>
</p>
<p>But that's no condition on V - curl of gradient is <em>always</em> zero. Of course, we used the curl law to show that <strong>E</strong> could be expressed as the gradient of a scalar, so it's not really surprising that this works out: <script type="math/tex"> \curl{\vec{E}} = 0 </script> permits our definition of V; in return, <script type="math/tex"> \vec{E} = - \grad{V} </script> guarantees <script type="math/tex"> \curl{\vec{E}} = 0 </script>. It only takes one differential equation (Poisson's) to determine V, because V is a scalar. For <script type="math/tex"> \vec{E} </script> we needed two, the divergence and the curl.</p>
<h3 id="234-the-potential-of-a-localized-charge-distribution">2.3.4: The potential of a Localized Charge Distribution</h3>
<p>I defined V in terms of <script type="math/tex"> \vec{E} \eqref{2.21} </script>. Ordinarily, though, it's <strong>E</strong> that we're looking for (if we already knew <strong>E</strong>, there wouldn't be much point in calculating V). The idea is that it might be easier to get V first, and then calculate <strong>E</strong> by taking the gradient. Typically, then, we know where the charge is (that is, we know <script type="math/tex"> \rho </script>), and we want to find V. Now, Poisson's equation relates V and <script type="math/tex"> \rho </script>, but unfortunately it's "the wrong way round": it would give us <script type="math/tex"> \rho </script> if we knew V, whereas we want V, knowing <script type="math/tex"> \rho </script>. What we must do, then, is "invert" Poisson's equation. That's the program for this section, although I shall do it by roundabout means, beginning, as always, with a point charge at the origin.</p>
<p>The electric field is <script type="math/tex"> \vec{E} = (1 / 4 \pi \epsilon_0)(1 / r^2) \hat{r} </script>, and <script type="math/tex"> \dd{\vec{l}} = \dd{r} \hat{r}  </script>, and <script type="math/tex"> \dd{\vec{l}} = \dd{r} \hat{r} + r \dd{\theta} \hat{\theta} + r \sin \theta \dd{\theta} \hat{\phi} </script>, so
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\vec{E} \cdot \dd{\vec{l}} = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{r^2} \dd{r} 
</script>
Setting the reference point at infinity, the potential of a point charge <em>q</em> at the origin is
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
V(r) = - \int_{\mathscr{O}} ^r \vec{E} \cdot \dd{\vec{l}} \\
 = \frac{-1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \int_{\infty}^r \frac{q}{r' ^2} \dd{r'} \\
 = \left.\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{r'} \right| ^r _{\infty} = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{r} 
</script>
</p>
<p>(You see here the advantage of using infinity for the reference point: it kills the lower limit on the integral.) Notice the sign of V; presumably the conventional minus sign in the definition was chosen in order to make the potential of a positive charge come out positive. It is useful to remember that regions of positive charge are potential "hills," and electric field points "downhill" from plus toward minus.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 2.32" src="../img/2.32.png" /></p>
<p>In general, the potential of a point charge q is
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
V(\vec{r}) = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{\gr} 
</script>
</p>
<p>where <script type="math/tex"> \gr </script>, as always, is the distance from <script type="math/tex"> q </script> to <script type="math/tex"> \vec{r} </script> (Fig 2.32). Invoking the superposition principle, then, the potential of a collection of charges is 
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
V(r) = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \sum_{i=1} ^n \frac{q_i}{\gr _i} 
</script>
or, for a continuous distribution,
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
V(r) = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \int \frac{\rho(\vec{r}')}{\gr} \dd{\tau'} \label{2.29} 
</script>
</p>
<p>This is the equation we were looking for, telling us how to compute V when we know <script type="math/tex"> \rho </script>; it is, if you like, the "solution" to Poisson's equation, for a localized charge distribution. Compare <script type="math/tex"> \eqref{2.29} </script> with the corresponding formula for the electric field in terms of <script type="math/tex"> \rho </script>:
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\vec{E}(\vec{r}) = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \int \frac{\rho(\vec{r'})}{\gr ^2} \hat{\gr} \dd{\tau'}
</script>
</p>
<p>The main point is that the pesky unit vector <script type="math/tex"> \hat{\gr} </script> is gone, so there is no need to fuss with components. The potentials of line and surface charges are
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
V = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \int \frac{\lambda(\vec{r'})}{\gr} \dd{l'} \qquad \text{ and } \qquad V = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \int \frac{\sigma(\vec{r'})}{\gr} \dd{a'}
</script>
</p>
<p>I should warn you that everything in this section is predicated on the assumption that the reference point is at infinity. This is hardly apparent in <script type="math/tex"> \eqref{2.29} </script>, but remember that we <em>got</em> the equation from the potential of a point charge at the origin, <script type="math/tex"> (1/4 \pi \epsilon_0) (q / r) </script>, which is valid only when <script type="math/tex"> \mathscr{O} = \infty </script>. If you try to apply these formulas to one of those artificial problems in which the charge itself extends to infinity, the integral will diverge.</p>
<h3 id="235-boundary-conditions">2.3.5: Boundary Conditions</h3>
<p>In the typical electrostatic problem you are given a source charge distribution <script type="math/tex"> \rho </script>, and you want to find the electric field <script type="math/tex"> \vec{E} </script> it produces. Unless the symmetry of the problem allows a solution by Gauss's law, it is generally to your advantage to calculate the potential first, as an intermediate step. These are the three fundamental quantities of electrostatics: <script type="math/tex"> \rho </script>, <script type="math/tex"> \vec{E} </script>, and <script type="math/tex"> V </script>. We have, in the course of our discussion, derived all six formulas interrelating them. These equations are neatly summarized in Fig. 2.35. We began with just two experimental observations: (1) the principle of superposition - a broad general rule applying to all electromagnetic forces, and (2) Coulomb's law - the fundamental law of electrostatics. From these, all else followed.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 2.35" src="../img/2.35.png" /></p>
<p>You may have noticed, in studying the exercises in this chapter, that the electric field always undergoes a discontinuity when you cross a surface charge <script type="math/tex"> \sigma </script>. In fact, it is a simple matter to find the <em>amount</em> by which E changes at such a boundary. Suppose we draw a wafer-thin Gaussian pillbox, extending just barely over the edge in each direction (Fig. 2.36). Gauss's law says that
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\oint _{S} \vec{E} \cdot \dd{\vec{a}} = \frac{1}{\epsilon_0} Q_{enc} = \frac{1}{\epsilon_0} \sigma A
</script>
</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 2.36" src="../img/2.36.png" />
where A is the area of the pillbox lid. If <script type="math/tex"> \sigma </script>  varies from point to point or the surface is curved, we can simply pick A to be extremely small. Now, the sides of the pillbox contribute nothing to the flux, in the limit as the thickness <script type="math/tex"> \epsilon </script>  goes to zero, so we are left with 
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
E_{above}^{\perp} - E_{below} ^{\perp} = \frac{1}{\epsilon_0} \sigma \label{2.31}
</script>
where <script type="math/tex"> E_{above}^{\perp} </script> denotes the component of <script type="math/tex"> \vec{E} </script> that is perpendicular to the surface immediately above, and <script type="math/tex">  E_{below} ^{\perp} </script> is the same, only just below the surface. For consistency, let "upward" be the positive direction for both. <em>Conclusion: the normal component of <script type="math/tex"> \vec{E} </script> is discontinuous by an amount <script type="math/tex"> \sigma / \epsilon_0 </script> at any boundary.</em> In particular, where there is <em>no</em> surface charge, <script type="math/tex"> \vec{E}^{\perp} </script> is continuous, as for instance at the surface of a uniformly charged solid sphere.</p>
<p>The <em>tangential</em> component of <script type="math/tex"> \vec{E} </script>, by contrast, is always continuous. For if we apply <script type="math/tex"> \eqref{2.19} </script>,
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\oint \vec{E} \cdot \dd{\vec{l}} = 0
</script>
to the thin rectangular loop of Fig 2.37, the ends give nothing (as <script type="math/tex"> \epsilon \rightarrow 0 </script>), and the sides give <script type="math/tex"> (E_{above} ^{\parallel} l - E_{below} ^{\parallel} l) </script>, so
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\vec{E}_{above} ^{\parallel} = \vec{E}_{below} ^{\parallel} \label{2.32}
</script>
where <script type="math/tex"> \vec{E}^{\parallel} </script> stands for the components of <script type="math/tex"> \vec{E} </script> parallel to the surface.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 2.36" src="../img/2.36.png" /></p>
<p>The boundary conditions on <script type="math/tex"> \vec{E} </script> (Eqs. <script type="math/tex"> \eqref{2.31} </script> and <script type="math/tex"> \eqref{2.32} </script>) can be combined into a single formula:
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\vec{E}_{above} - \vec{E}_{below} = \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon_0} \hat{n} \label{2.33}
</script>
where <script type="math/tex"> \hat{n} </script> is a unit vector perpendicular to the surface, pointing from "below" to "above."</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 2.37" src="../img/2.37.png" />
<img alt="Figure 2.38" src="../img/2.38.png" /></p>
<p>The potential, meanwhile, is continuous across any boundary (Fig 2.38), since
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
V_{above} - V_{below} = -\int_{a}^{b} \vec{E} \cdot \dd{\vec{l}}
</script>
as the path length shrinks to zero, so too does the integral
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
V_{above} = V_{below} \label{2.34}
</script>
</p>
<p>However, the <em>gradient</em> of V inherits the discontinuity in <script type="math/tex"> \vec{E} </script>, since <script type="math/tex"> \vec{E} - \grad{V} </script>, so
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\grad{V}_{above} - \grad{V}_{below} = - \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon_0} \hat{n}
</script>
or more conveniently
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\pdv{V_{above}}{n} - \pdv{V_{below}}{n} = - \frac{1}{\epsilon_0} \sigma \label{2.36}
</script>
where
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\pdv{V}{n} = \grad{V} \cdot \hat{n}
</script>
denotes the normal derivative of V (that is, the rate of change in the direction perpendicular to the surface).</p>
<p>Please note that these boundary conditions relate the fields and potentials <em>just</em> above and <em>just</em> below the surface. For example, the derivatives in <script type="math/tex"> \eqref{2.36} </script> are the limiting values as we approach the surface from either side. </p>

<h3 id="241-the-work-it-takes-to-move-a-charge">2.4.1: The Work it Takes to Move a Charge</h3>
<p>Suppose you have a stationary configuration of source charges, and you want to move a test charge Q from point a to point b (Fig. 2.39). <em>Question</em>: how much work will you have to do? At any point along the path, the electric force on Q is <script type="math/tex"> \vec{F} = Q \vec{E} </script>; the force you must exert, in opposition to the electric force, is <script type="math/tex"> -Q\vec{E} </script>. The work you do is therefore
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
W = \int_{a}^{b} \vec{F} \cdot \dd{\vec{l}} \\
= - Q \int_{a}^{b} \vec{E} \cdot \dd{\vec{l}}  \\
= - Q[V(b) - V(a)]
</script>
</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 2.39" src="../img/2.39.png" /></p>
<p>Notice that the answer is independent of the path you take from a to b; in mechanics, then, we would call the electrostatic force "conservative." Dividing through by Q, we have
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
V(b) - V(a) = \frac{W}{Q} 
</script>
</p>
<p>In words, the potential difference between points a and b is equal to the work per unit charge required to carry a particle from a to b. In particular, if you want to bring Q in from far away and stick it at point r, the work you must do is
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
W = Q[V(\vec{r}) - V(\infty)],
</script>
so if you have set the reference point at infinity,
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
W = Q V(\vec{r}) \label{2.39}
</script>
In this sense, potential is potential <em>energy</em> (the work it takes to create a system) <em>per unit charge</em> (just as the field is force per unit charge).</p>
<h3 id="242-the-energy-of-a-point-charge-distribution">2.4.2: The Energy of a Point Charge Distribution</h3>

(<script type="math/tex"> \gr_{12} </script> is the distance between <script type="math/tex"> q_1 </script> and <script type="math/tex"> q_2 </script>, once they are in position). As you bring in each charge, nail it down in its final location, so it doesn't move when you bring in the next charge. Now bring in <script type="math/tex"> q_3 </script>. This requires work <script type="math/tex"> q_3 V_{1,2}(\vec{r}_3) </script>, where <script type="math/tex"> V_{1,2} </script> is the potential due to charges <script type="math/tex"> q_1 </script> and <script type="math/tex"> q_2 </script>, namely <script type="math/tex"> (1 / 4 \pi \epsilon_0) (q_1 / \gr_{13} + q_2 / \gr_{23} ) </script>. Thus
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
W_3 = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} q_3 \left( \frac{q_1}{\gr_{13}} + \frac{q_2}{\gr_{23}}   \right)
</script>
Similarly, the extra work to bring in <script type="math/tex"> q_4 </script>  will be
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
W_4 = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} q_4 \left( \frac{q_1}{\gr_{14}} + \frac{q_2}{\gr_{24}} + \frac{q_3}{\gr_{34}} \right)
</script>
The <em>total</em> work necessary to assemble the first four charges, then, is
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
W = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \left( \frac{q_1 q_2}{\gr_{12}} + \frac{q_1 q_3}{\gr_{13}} + \frac{q_1 q_4}{\gr_{14}} + \frac{q_2 q_3}{\gr_{23}} + \frac{q_2 q_4}{\gr_{24}} + \frac{q_3 q_4}{\gr_{34}} \right)
</script>
</p>
<p>You see the general rule: Take the product of each pair of charges, divide by their separation distance, and add it all up:
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
W = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \sum_{i = 1} ^{n} \sum_{j > i} ^n \frac{q_i q_j}{\gr_{ij}} 
</script>
The stipulation <script type="math/tex"> j > i </script> is to remind you not to count the same pair twice. A nicer way to accomplish this is <em>intentionally</em> to count each pair twice, and then divide by 2:
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
W = \frac{1}{8 \pi \epsilon_0} \sum_{i = 1} ^n \sum_{j \neq i} \frac{q_i q_j}{\gr_{ij}}  
</script>
(we must still avoid <script type="math/tex"> i = j </script>, of course). Notice that in this form the answer plainly does not depend on the <em>order</em> in which you assemble the charges, since every pair occurs in the sum.</p>
<p>Finally, let's pull out the factor <script type="math/tex"> q_i </script>:
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
W = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i = 1}^n q_i \left( \sum_{j \neq i} ^n \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q_j}{\gr_{ij}}  \right)
</script>
</p>
<p>The term in parentheses is the potential at point <script type="math/tex"> \vec{r_i} </script> (the position of <script type="math/tex"> q_i </script> ) due to all the <em>other</em> charges - all of them, now, not just the ones that were present at some stage during the assembly. Thus,
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
W = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i = 1} ^n q_i V(\vec{r_i}) \label{2.42}
</script>
That's how much work it takes to assemble a configuration of point charges; it's also the amount of work you'd get back if you dismantled the system. In the meantime, it represents energy stored in the configuration ("potential" energy, if you insist, though for obvious reasons I prefer to avoid that word in this context).</p>

<p>For a volume charge density <script type="math/tex"> \rho </script>, <script type="math/tex"> \eqref{2.42} </script> becomes
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
W = \frac{1}{2} \int \rho V \dd{\tau} \label{2.43}
</script>
There is a lovely way to write this result, in which <script type="math/tex"> \rho </script>  and <script type="math/tex"> V </script> are eliminated in favor of <script type="math/tex"> \vec{E} </script>. First, use Gauss's law to express <script type="math/tex"> \rho </script> in terms of <script type="math/tex"> \vec{E} </script>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\rho = \epsilon_0 \div{\vec{E}} \qquad \text{so,} \qquad W = \frac{\epsilon_0}{2} \int (\div{\vec{E}}) V \dd{\tau}
</script>
Now, use integration by parts to transfer the derivative from <script type="math/tex"> \vec{E} </script> to <script type="math/tex"> V </script>:
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
W = \frac{\epsilon_0}{2} \left[ - \int \vec{E} \cdot (\grad{V}) \dd{\tau} + \oint V \vec{E} \cdot \dd{\vec{a}} \right]
</script>
But <script type="math/tex"> \grad{V} = - \vec{E} </script>, so
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
 W = \frac{\epsilon_0}{2} \left( \int_{\mathscr{V}} E^2 \dd{\tau} + \oint V \vec{E} \cdot \dd{\vec{a}} \right) \label{2.44}
 </script>
</p>
<p>But what volume is this we're integrating over? Let's go back to the formula we started with, <script type="math/tex"> \eqref{2.43} </script>. From its derivation, it is clear that we should integrate over the region where the charge is located. But actually, any larger volume would do just as well: The "extra" territory we throw in will contribute nothing to the integral, since <script type="math/tex"> \rho = 0 </script> out there. With this in mind, we return to <script type="math/tex"> \eqref{2.44} </script>. What happens here, as we enlarge the volume beyond the minimum necessary to trap all the charge? Well, the integral of <script type="math/tex"> E^2 </script> can only increase (the integrand being positive); evidently the surface integral must decrease accordingly to leave the sum intact. (In fact, at large distances from the charge, <script type="math/tex"> E </script> goes like <script type="math/tex"> 1 / r^2 </script> and <script type="math/tex"> V </script> like <script type="math/tex"> 1/r </script>, while the surface area grows like <script type="math/tex"> r^2 </script>; roughly speaking, then, the surface integral goes down like <script type="math/tex"> 1/r </script>. Please understand: <script type="math/tex"> \eqref{2.44} </script> gives you the correct energy W, whatever volume you use (as long as it encloses all the charge), but the contribution of the volume integral goes up, and that of the surface integral goes down, as you take larger and larger volumes. In particular, why not integrate over <em>all</em> space? Then the surface integral goes to zero, and we are left with
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
W = \frac{\epsilon_0}{2} \int E^2 \dd{\tau} \quad \text{(all space)} \label{2.45}

<h3 id="244-comments-on-electrostatic-energy">2.4.4: Comments on Electrostatic Energy</h3>
<p><strong>A perplexing "inconsistency"</strong></p>
<p>Equation <script type="math/tex"> \eqref{2.45} </script> clearly implies that the energy of a stationary charge distribution is always positive. On the other hand, <script type="math/tex"> \eqref{2.42} </script> (from which <script type="math/tex"> \eqref{2.45} </script> was in fact derived), can be positive or negative. For instance, according to <script type="math/tex"> \eqref{2.42} </script> the energy of two equal but opposite charges a distance <script type="math/tex"> \gr </script> apart is <script type="math/tex"> -(1/4 \pi \epsilon_0) (q^2/\gr) </script>. What's gone wrong? Which equation is correct?</p>
<p>The answer is that <em>both</em> are correct, but they speak to slightly different questions. Equation <script type="math/tex"> \eqref{2.42} </script> does not take into account the work necessary to make the point charges in the first place; we started with point charges and simply found the work required to bring them together. This is wise strategy, since <script type="math/tex"> \eqref{2.45} </script> indicates that the energy of a point charge is in fact <em>infinite</em>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
 W = \frac{\epsilon_0}{2(4 \pi \epsilon_0)^2} \int \left( \frac{q^2}{r^4}  \right) (r^2 \sin \theta \dd{r} \dd{\theta} \dd{\phi}) = \frac{q^2}{8 \pi \epsilon_0} \int_{0} ^{\infty} \frac{1}{r^2} \dd{r} = \infty
 </script>
</p>
<p>Equation <script type="math/tex"> \eqref{2.45}  </script> is more <em>complete</em>, in the sense that it tells you the <em>total</em> energy stored in a charge configuration, but <script type="math/tex"> \eqref{2.42} </script> is more appropriate when you're dealing with point charges, because we prefer (for good reason!) to leave out that portion of the total energy that is attributable to the fabrication of the point charges themselves. In practice, after all, the point charges (electrons, say) are <em>given</em> to us ready-made; all we do is move them around. Since we did not put them together, and we cannot take them apart, it is immaterial how much work the process would involve. (Still, the infinite energy of a point charge is a recurring source of embarrassment for electromagnetic theory, afflicting the quantum version as well as the classical. We shall return to the problem in Chapter 11).</p>
<p>Now, you may wonder where the inconsistency crept into an apparently water-tight derivation. The "flaw" lies between <script type="math/tex"> \eqref{2.42} </script> and <script type="math/tex"> \eqref{2.43} </script>: in the former, <script type="math/tex"> V(\vec{r_i}) </script> represents the potential due to all the other charges, <em>but not</em> <script type="math/tex"> q_i </script>, whereas in the latter, <script type="math/tex"> V(\vec{r}) </script> is the full potential. For a continuous distribution, there is no distinction, since the amount of charge right at the point <script type="math/tex"> \vec{r} </script> is vanishingly small, and its contribution to the potential is zero. But in the presence of point charges you'd better stick with <script type="math/tex"> \eqref{2.42} </script>.    </p>
<p><strong>Where is the energy stored?</strong> Equations <script type="math/tex"> \eqref{2.43} </script> and <script type="math/tex"> \eqref{2.45} </script> offer two different ways of calculating the same thing. The first is an integral over the charge distribution, the second is an integral over the field. These can involve completely different regions. For instance, in the case of a spherical shell, the charge is confined to the surface, whereas the electric field is everywhere <em>outside</em> this surface. Where <em>is</em> the energy, then? Is it stored in the field, as <script type="math/tex"> \eqref{2.45} </script> seems to suggest, or is it stored in the charge, as <script type="math/tex"> \eqref{2.43} </script> implies? At the present stage this is simply an unanswerable question: I can tell you what the total energy is, and I can provide you with several different ways to compute it, but it is impertinent to worry about where the energy is located. In the context of radiation theory (Chapter 11) it is useful (and in general relativity it is essential) to regard the energy as stored in the field, with a density
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\frac{\epsilon_0}{2} E^2 = \text{ energy per unit volume} \label{2.46}
</script>
</p>
<p>But in electrostatics one could just as well say it is stored in the charge, with a density <script type="math/tex"> \frac{1}{2} \rho V </script>. The difference is purely a matter of bookkeeping.</p>
<p><strong>The superposition principle</strong>. Because electrostatic energy is <em>quadratic</em> in the fields, it does not obey a superposition principle. The energy of a compound system is <em>not</em> the sum of the energies of its parts considered separately - there are also "cross terms":
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\begin{align}
W_{tot} & = & \frac{\epsilon_0}{2} \int E^2 \dd{\tau} = \frac{\epsilon_0}{2} \int (\vec{E_1} + \vec{E_2})^2 \dd{\tau} \\
 & = & \frac{\epsilon_0}{2} \int (E_1 ^2 + E_2 ^2 + 2 \vec{E_1} \cdot \vec{E_2}) \dd{\tau} \\
 & = & W_1 + W_2 + \epsilon_0 \int \vec{E_1} \cdot \vec{E_2} \dd{\tau}
\end{align}
</script>
</p>
<p>For example, if you double the charge everywhere, you <em>quadruple</em> the total energy.</p>
<h2 id="25-conductors">2.5: Conductors</h2>
<h3 id="251-basic-properties">2.5.1: Basic Properties</h3>
<p>In an <em>insulator</em>, such as glass or rubber, each electron is on a short leash, attached to a particular atom. In a metallic <em>conductor</em>, by contrast, one or more electrons per atom are free to roam. (In liquid conductors such as salt water, it is ions that do the moving). A <em>perfect</em> conductor would contain an unlimited supply of free charges. In real life there are no perfect conductors, but metals come pretty close, for most purposes.</p>
<p>From this definition, the basic electrostatic properties of ideal conductors immediately follow:</p>
<p><strong>(i) E = 0 inside a conductor</strong>. Why? Because if there were any field, those free charges would move, and it wouldn't be <em>electrostatics</em> any more. Hmm... that's hardly a satisfactory explanation; maybe all it proves is that you can't have electrostatics when conductors are present. We had better examine what happens when you put a conductor into an external electric field <script type="math/tex"> \vec{E_0} </script> (Fig. 2.42). Initially, the field will drive any free positive charges to the right, and negative ones to the left. (In practice, it's the negative charges - electrons - that do the moving, but when they depart, the right side is left with a net positive charge - the stationary nuclei - so it doesn't really matter which charges move; the effect is the same). When they come to the edge of the material, the charges pile up: plus on the right side, minus on the left. Now, these <strong>induced charges</strong> produce a field of their own, <script type="math/tex"> \vec{E_1} </script>, which, as you can see from the figure, is in the opposite direction to <script type="math/tex"> \vec{E_0} </script>. That's the crucial point, for it means that the field of the induced charges tends to cancel the original field. Charge will continue to flow until this cancellation is complete, and the resultant field inside the conductor is precisely zero. The whole process is practically instantaneous.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 2.42" src="../img/2.42.png" /></p>
<p><strong>(ii) <script type="math/tex"> \rho = 0 </script> inside a conductor.</strong> This follows from Gauss's law: if E is zero, so also is <script type="math/tex"> \rho </script>. There is still charge around, but exactly as much plus as minus, so the net charge density in the interior is zero.</p>
<p><strong>(iii) Any net charge resides on the surface</strong>. That's the only place left.</p>
<p><strong>(iv) A conductor is an equipotential</strong>. For if a and b are any two points within (or at the surface of) a given conductor, <script type="math/tex"> V(b) - V(a) = - \int _{a} ^{b} \vec{E} \cdot \dd{\vec{l}} = 0 </script>, and hence <script type="math/tex"> V(a) = V(b) </script>.</p>
<p><strong>(v) E is perpendicular to the surface, just outside a conductor.</strong> Otherwise, as in (i), charge will immediately flow around the surface until it kills off the tangential component (Fig. 2.43). (Perpendicular to the surface, charge cannot flow, of course, since it is confined to the conducting object.)</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 2.43" src="../img/2.43.png" /></p>
<p>I think it is astonishing that the charge on a conductor flows to the surface. Because of their mutual repulsion, the charges naturally spread out as much as possible, but for <em>all</em> of them to go to the surface seems like a waste of the interior space. Surely we could do better, from the point of view of making each charge as possible from its neighbors, to sprinkle <em>some</em> of them throughout the volume. Well, it simply is not so. You do best to put all the charge on the surface, and this is true regardless of the size or shape of the conductor.</p>
<p>The problem can also be phrased in terms of energy. Like any other free dynamical system, the charge on a conductor will seek the configuration that minimizes its potential energy. What property (iii) asserts is that the electrostatic energy of a solid object (with specified shape and total charge) is a minimum when that charge is spread over the surface. For instance, the energy of a sphere is <script type="math/tex"> (1 / 8 \pi \epsilon_0)(q^2 / R) </script> if the charge is uniformly distributed over the surface, as we found in Ex 2.9, but it is greater <script type="math/tex"> (3/20 \pi \epsilon_0)(q^2 / R) </script> if the charge is uniformly distributed throughout the volume (Prob. 2.34). </p>
<h3 id="252-induced-charges">2.5.2: Induced Charges</h3>
<p>If you hold a charge +q near an uncharged conductor (Fig 2.44), the two will attract one another. The reason for this is that q will pull minus charges over to the near side and repel plus charges to the far side (Another way to think of it is that the charge moves around in such a way as to kill off the field of q for points inside the conductor, where the total field must be zero.) Since the negative induced charge is closer to q, there is a net force of attraction. (In chapter 3 we will calculate this force explicitly, for the case of a spherical conductor.)</p>
<p>When I speak of the field, charge, or potential "inside" a conductor, I mean in the "meat" of the conductor. If there is some hollow cavity in the conductor, and within that cavity you put some charge, then the field in the cavity will not be zero. But in a remarkable way the cavity and its contents are electrically isolated from the outside world by the surrounding conductor (Fig. 2.45). No external fields penetrate the conductor; they are canceled at the outer surface by the induced charge there. Similarly, the field due to charges within the cavity is canceled, for all exterior points, by the induced charge on the inner surface. However, the compensating charge left over on the <em>outer</em> surface of the conductor effectively "communicates" the presence of q to the outside world. The total charge induced on the cavity wall is equal and opposite to the charge inside, for if we surround the cavity with a Gaussian surface, all points of which are in the conductor (Fig 2.45), <script type="math/tex"> \oint \vec{E} \cdot \dd{\vec{a}} = 0 </script>, and hence (by Gauss's law) the net enclosed charge must be zero. But <script type="math/tex"> Q_{enc} = q + q_{induced} </script>, so <script type="math/tex"> q_{induced} = - q </script>. Then if the conductor as a whole is electrically neutral, there must be a charge +q on its outer surface.</p>

<h4 id="example-210">Example 2.10</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>An uncharged spherical conductor centered at the origin has a cavity of some weird shape carved out of it (Fig. 2.46). Somewhere within the cavity is a charge q. Question: What is the field outside the sphere?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Figure 2.46" src="../img/2.46.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong> 
At first glance, it would appear that the answer depends on the shape of the cavity and the location of the charge. But that's wrong: the answer is
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\vec{E} = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{r^2} \hat{r}
</script>
</p>
<p>regardless. The conductor conceals from us all information concerning the nature of the cavity, revealing only the total charge it contains. How can this be? Well, the charge +q induces an opposite charge -q on the wall of the cavity, which distributes itself in such a way that its field cancels that of q, for all points exterior to the cavity. Since the conductor carries no net charge, this leaves +q to distribute itself uniformly over the surface of the sphere. (It's <em>uniform</em> because the asymmetrical influence of the point charge +q is negated by that of the induced charge -q on the inner surface.) For points outside the sphere, then, the only thing that survives is the field of the leftover +q, uniformly distributed over the outer surface.</p>
<p>It may occur to you that in one respect this argument is open to challenge: There are actually <em>three</em> fields at work here: <script type="math/tex"> \vec{E_q}, \vec{E_{induced}} </script>, and <script type="math/tex"> \vec{E_{leftover}} </script>. All we know for certain is that the sum of the three is zero inside the conductor, yet I claimed that the first two alone cancel, while the third is separately zero there. Moreover, even if the first two cancel within the conductor, who is to say they still cancel for points outside? They do not, after all, cancel for points inside the cavity. I cannot give you a completely satisfactory answer at the moment, but this much at least is true: there <em>exists</em> a way of distributing -q over the inner surface so as to cancel the field of q at all exterior points. For that same cavity could have been carved out of a <em>huge</em> spherical conductor with a radius of 27 miles or light years or whatever. In that case, the leftover +q on the outer surface is simply too far away to produce a significant field, and the other two fields would have to accomplish the cancellation by themselves. So we know they can do it... but are we sure they <em>choose</em> to? Perhaps for small spheres nature prefers some complicated three-way cancellation? Nope: As we'll see in the uniqueness theorems of Chapter 3, electrostatics is very stingy with its options; there is always precisely one way - no more - of distributing the charge on a conductor so as to make the field inside zero. Having found a possible way, we are guaranteed that no alternative exists, even in principle.  </p>
<hr />
<p>If a cavity surrounded by conducting material is itself empty of charge, then the field within the cavity is zero. For any field line would have to begin and end on the cavity wall, going from a plus charge to a minus charge (Fig 2.47). Letting that field line be part of a closed loop, the rest of which is entirely inside the conductor (where E = 0), the integral <script type="math/tex"> \oint \vec{E} \cdot \dd{\vec{l}} </script> is distinctly <em>positive</em>, in violation of <script type="math/tex"> \eqref{2.19} </script>. It follows that <script type="math/tex"> E = 0 </script> within an empty cavity, and there is in vact no charge on the surface of the cavity. (This is why you are relatively safe inside a metal car during a thunderstorm - you may get cooked, if lightning strikes, but you will not be electrocuted. The same principle applies to the placement of sensitive apparatus inside a grounded <strong>Faraday cage</strong>, to shield out stray electric fields. In practice, the enclosure doesn't even have to be solid conductor - chicken wire will often suffice.)</p>

<h3 id="253-surface-charge-and-the-force-on-a-conductor">2.5.3: Surface Charge and the Force on a Conductor</h3>
<p>Because the field inside a conductor is zero, boundary condition <script type="math/tex"> \eqref{2.33} </script> requires that the field immediately outside is

 </script>
</p>
<p>consistent with our earlier conclusion that the field is normal to the surface. In terms of potential, <script type="math/tex"> \eqref{2.36} </script> yields
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\sigma = - \epsilon_0 \pdv{V}{n} \label{2.49}
</script>
These equations enable you to calculate the surface charge on a conductor, if you can determine <script type="math/tex"> \vec{E} </script> or <script type="math/tex"> V </script>; we shall use them frequently in the next chapter.</p>
<p>In the presence of an electric field, a surface charge will experience a force; the force per unit area, <script type="math/tex"> \vec{f} </script>, is <script type="math/tex"> \sigma \vec{E} </script>. But there's a problem here, for the electric field is discontinuous at a surface charge, so what are we supposed to use: <script type="math/tex"> \vec{E}_{above}, \vec{E}_{below} </script>, or something in between? The answer is that we should use the <em>average</em> of the two
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
 \vec{f} = \sigma \vec{E}_{average} = \frac{1}{2} \sigma (\vec{E}_{above} + \vec{E}_{below}) \label{2.50}
</script>
Why the average? The reason is very simple, thought the telling makes it sound complicated: Let's focus our attention on a tiny patch of surface surrounding the point in question (Fig. 2.50). Make it small enough so it is essentially flat and the surface in question is essentially constant. The total field consists of two parts - that attributable to the patch itself, and that due to everything else (other regions of the surface, as well as any external sources that may be present)
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\vec{E} = \vec{E}_{patch} + \vec{E}_{other}
</script>
Now, the patch cannot exert a force on itself, any more than you can lift yourself by standing in a basket and pulling up on the handles. The force on the patch, then, is exclusively due to <script type="math/tex"> \vec{E}_{other} </script>, and this suffers no discontinuity (if we removed the patch, the field in the "hole" would be perfectly smooth). The discontinuity is due entirely to the charge on the patch, which puts out a field <script type="math/tex"> (\sigma / 2 \epsilon_0) </script> on either side, pointing away from the surface. Thus,

 \vec{E}_{above} = \vec{E}_{other} + \frac{\sigma}{2 \epsilon_0} \hat{n} \\
 \vec{E}_{below} = \vec{E}_{other} - \frac{\sigma}{2 \epsilon_0} \hat{n} \\
 </script> 
and hence
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\vec{E}_{other} = \frac{1}{2} (\vec{E}_{above} + \vec{E}_{below}) = \vec{E}_{average}
</script>
Averaging is really just a device for removing the contribution of the patch itself.</p>
<p>That argument applies to any surface charge; in the particular case of a conductor, the field is zero inside and <script type="math/tex"> (\sigma / \epsilon_0)\hat{n} </script> outside (<script type="math/tex"> \eqref{2.48} </script>, so the average is <script type="math/tex"> (\sigma / 2 \epsilon_0) \hat{n} </script>, and the force per unit area is
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
 f = \frac{1}{2 \epsilon_0} \sigma ^2 \hat{n} \label{2.51}
 </script> 
This amounts to an outward <strong>electrostatic pressure</strong> on the surface, tending to draw the conductor into the field, regardless of the sign of <script type="math/tex"> \sigma </script>. Expressing the pressure in terms of the field just outside the surface
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
 P = \frac{\epsilon_0}{2} E^2

<p>Suppose we have two conductors, and we put charge +Q on one and -Q on the other (Fig 2.51). Since V is constant over a conductor, we can speak unambiguously of the potential difference between them:
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
V = V_{+} - V_{-} = - \int_{(-)}^{(+)} \vec{E} \cdot \dd{\vec{l}}
</script>
We don't know how the charge distributes itself over the two conductors, and calculating the field would be a nightmare, if their shapes are complicated, but this much we do know: <script type="math/tex"> \vec{E} </script> is proportional to <script type="math/tex"> Q </script>. For <script type="math/tex"> \vec{E} </script> is given by Coulomb's law:
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\vec{E} = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \int \frac{\rho}{\gr^2} \hat{\gr} \dd{\tau}
</script>
so if you double <script type="math/tex"> \rho </script>, you double <script type="math/tex"> \vec{E} </script>. Wait a minute! How do we know that doubling Q (and also -Q) simply doubles <script type="math/tex"> \rho </script>? Maybe the charge moves around into a completely different configuration, quadrupling <script type="math/tex"> \rho </script> in some places and halving it in others, just so the total charge on the conductor is doubled. The fact is that this concern is unwarranted - doubling Q <em>does</em> double <script type="math/tex"> \rho </script>  everywhere; it doesn't shift charge around. The proof will come in Chapter 3; for now you'll have to trust me.</p>
<p>Since <script type="math/tex"> \vec{E} </script> is proportional to Q, so also is V. The constant of proportionality is called the <strong>capacitance</strong> of the arrangement
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
C \equiv \frac{Q}{V}  \label{2.53}
</script>
Capacitance is a purely geometrical quantity, determined by the sizes, shapes, and separation of the two conductors. In SI units, C is measured in <em>farads</em> (F); a farad is a coulomb-per-volt. Actually this turns out to be inconveniently large; more practical units are the microfarad (<script type="math/tex"> 10^{-6} F </script>) and the picofarad (<script type="math/tex"> 10^{-12} F </script>)</p>
<p>Notice that V is, by definition, the potential of the positive conductor less that of the negative one; likewise, Q is the charge of the positive conductor. Accordingly, capacitance is an intrinsically positive quantity. By the way, you will occasionally hear someone speak of the capacitance of a single conductor. In this case the "second conductor" is an imaginary spherical shell of infinite radius surrounding the one conductor. It contributes nothing to the field, so the capacitance is given by <script type="math/tex"> \eqref{2.53} </script>, where V is the potential with infinity as the reference point.</p>

<h4 id="example-211">Example 2.11</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Find the capacitance of a parallel-plate capacitor consisting of two metal surfaces of area A held a distance d apart (Fig. 2.52)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Figure 2.52" src="../img/2.52.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>
If we put +Q on the top and -Q on the bottom, they will spread out uniformly over the two surfaces, provided the area is reasonably large and the separation small. The surface charge density, then, is <script type="math/tex"> \sigma = Q / A </script> on the top plate, and so the field, according to Ex. 2.6, is <script type="math/tex"> (1 / \epsilon_0) Q / A </script>. The potential difference between the plates is therefore
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
V = \frac{Q}{A \epsilon_0} d
</script>
and hence
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
C = \frac{A \epsilon_0}{d} \label{2.54}
</script>
If, for instance, the plates are square with sides 1 cm long, and they are held 1 mm apart, then the capacitance is <script type="math/tex"> 9 \times 10^{-13} F </script>
</p>
<hr />
<h4 id="example-212">Example 2.12</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Find the capacitance of two concentric spherical metal shells, with radii a and b.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>
Place charge +Q on the inner sphere, and -Q on the outer one. The field between the spheres is
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\vec{E} = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{Q}{r^2} \vec{r}
</script>
so the potential difference between them is
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
V = - \int_{b}^{a} \vec{E} \cdot \dd{\vec{l}} = - \frac{Q}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \int_{b}^a \frac{1}{r^2} \dd{r} = \frac{Q}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \left( \frac{1}{a} - \frac{1}{b}   \right)
</script>
As promised, V is proportional to Q; the capacitance is
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
C = \frac{Q}{V} = 4 \pi \epsilon_0 \frac{ab}{(b - a)} 
</script>
</p>
<hr />
<p>To "charge up" a capacitor, you have to remove electrons from the positive plate and carry them to the negative plate. In doing so, you fight against the electric field, which is pulling them back toward the positive conductor and pushing them away from the negative one. How much work does it take, then, to charge the capacitor up to a final amount <script type="math/tex"> Q </script>? Suppose that at some intermediate stage in the process the charge on the positive plate is <script type="math/tex"> q </script>, so that the potential difference is <script type="math/tex"> q / C </script>. According to <script type="math/tex"> \eqref{2.38} </script>, the work you must do to transport the next piece of charge <script type="math/tex"> dq </script> is
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\dd{W} = \left( \frac{q}{C} \right) \dd{q}
</script>
The total work necessary, then, to go from <script type="math/tex"> q = 0 </script> to <script type="math/tex"> q = Q </script>, is
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
W = \int_{0} ^Q \left( \frac{q}{C} \dd{q} \right) = \frac{1}{2} \frac{Q^2}{C} 
</script>
or, since <script type="math/tex"> Q = CV </script>,
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
 W = \frac{1}{2} C V^2 \label{2.55}
 </script> 
where <script type="math/tex"> V </script> is the final potential of the capacitor.</p>
