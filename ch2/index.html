<h2 id="21-the-electric-field">2.1: The Electric Field</h2>
<h3 id="211-introduction">2.1.1: Introduction</h3>
<p>The fundamental problem electrodynamics hopes to solve is this (Fig 2.1): We have some electric charges <script type="math/tex"> q_1, q_2, q_3, \ldots </script> (call them <em>source charges</em>); what force do they exert on another charge, <script type="math/tex"> Q </script> (call it the <em>test charge</em>)? The positions of the source charges are given (as functions of time); the trajectory of the test particle is to be calculated. In general, both the source charges and the test charge are in motion.</p>
<p><img alt="Fig 2.1" src="../img/2.1.png" /></p>
<p>The solution to this problem is facilitated by the principle of superposition, which states that the interaction between any two charges is completely unaffected by the presence of others. This means that to determine the force on Q, we can first compute the force <script type="math/tex"> \vec{F_1} </script>, due to <script type="math/tex"> q_1 </script> alone (ignoring all the others); then we compute the force <script type="math/tex"> \vec{F_2} </script>, due to <script type="math/tex"> q_2 </script> alone, and so in. Finally, we take the vector sum of all these individual forces: <script type="math/tex"> \vec{F} = \vec{F_1} + \vec{F_2} + \vec{F_3} + \ldots </script> Thus, if we can find the force on Q due to a <em>single</em> source charge <script type="math/tex"> q </script>, we are, in principle, done (the rest is just a question of repeating the same operation over and over, and adding it all up)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The principle of superposition may seem "obvious" to you, but it did not have to be so simple: if the electromagnetic force were proportional to the <em>square</em> of the total source charge, for instance, the principle of superposition would not hold, since <script type="math/tex"> (q_1 + q_2)^2 \neq q_1 ^2 + q_2 ^2 </script> (there would be "cross terms" to consider). Superposition is not a logical necessity, but an experimental fact.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, at first sight this looks very easy: Why don't I just write down the formula for the force on Q due to q, and be done with it? I <em>could</em>, and in Chapter 10 I shall, but you would be shocked to see it at this stage, for not only does the force on Q depend on the separation distance <script type="math/tex"> \gr </script> between the charges (Fig 2.2), it also depends on both their velocities and on the acceleration of <script type="math/tex"> q </script>. Moreover, it is not the position, velocity, and acceleration of <script type="math/tex"> q </script>
<em>right now</em> that matter: electromagnetic "news" travels at the speed of light, so what concerns Q is the position, velocity, and acceleration q had at some earlier time, when the message left.</p>
<p>Therefore, in spite of the fact that the basic question ("What is the force on Q due to q?") is easy to state, it does not pay to confront it head on; rather, we shall go at it by stages. In the meantime, the theory we develop will allow for the solution of more subtle electromagnetic problems that do not present themselves in quite this simple format. To begin with, we shall consider the special case of <em>electrostatics</em> in which all the source charges are stationary (though the test charge may be moving).</p>
<h3 id="212-coulombs-law">2.1.2: Coulomb's Law</h3>
<p>What is the force on a test charge Q due to a single point charge q, that is at <em>rest</em> a distance <script type="math/tex"> \gr </script> away? The answer (based on experiments) is given by <em>Coulomb's Law</em>:</p>
<p>
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\vec{F} = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0}\frac{q Q}{\gr^2} \hat{\vec{\gr}}   \label{coulomblaw}
</script>
</p>
<p>The constant <script type="math/tex"> \epsilon_0 </script>  is called (ludicrously) the <em>permittivity of free space</em>. In SI units, where force is in newtons (N), distance in meters (m), and charge in coulombs (C), 
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\epsilon_0 = 8.85 \times 10^{-12} \frac{C^2}{N \cdot m ^2} 
</script>
</p>
<p>In words, the force is proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the separation distance. As always (Sect 1.1.4), <script type="math/tex"> \vec{\gr} </script> is the separation vector from <script type="math/tex"> \vec{r'} </script> (the location of q) to <script type="math/tex"> \vec{r} </script> (the location of Q): <script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\vec{\gr} = \vec{r} - \vec{r}'
</script>
</p>
<p>
<script type="math/tex"> \gr </script> is its magnitude, and <script type="math/tex"> \hat{\gr} </script> is its direction. The force points along the line from q to Q; it is repulsive if <em>q</em> and <em>Q</em> have the same sign, and attractive if their signs are opposite.</p>
<p>Coulomb's law and the principle of superposition constitute the physical input for electrostatics - the rest, except for some special properties of matter, is mathematical elaboration of these fundamental rules.</p>
<h3 id="213-the-electric-field">2.1.3: The Electric Field</h3>
<p>If we have <em>several</em> point charges <script type="math/tex"> q_1, q_2, \ldots , q_n </script>  at distances <script type="math/tex"> \gr_1 \gr_2 \ldots, \gr_n </script> from <em>Q</em>, the total force on <em>Q</em> is evidently
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\begin{align}
\vec{F} & = & \vec{F_1} + \vec{F_2} + \ldots \\
& = & \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \left( \frac{q_1 Q}{\gr_1 ^2} \hat{\gr}_1 + \frac{q_2 Q}{\gr_2 ^2} \hat{\gr}_2 + \ldots \right) \\
& = & \frac{Q}{4 \pi \epsilon _0} \left( \frac{q_1}{\gr ^2 _1} \hat{\gr_1} + \frac{q_2}{\gr _2 ^2}\hat{\gr_2} + \ldots \right) 
\end{align}
</script>
</p>
<p>or
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\vec{F} = Q \vec{E} \label{2.3}
</script>
</p>
<p>where 
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\vec{E}(\vec{r}) \equiv \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \sum_{i = 1}^n \frac{q_i}{\gr_{i}^2} \hat{\gr_i} \label{2.4}
</script>
</p>
<p><strong>E</strong> is called the <strong>electric field</strong> of the source charges. Notice that it is a function of position (<strong>r</strong>), because the separation vectors <script type="math/tex"> \gr_i </script> depend on the location of the field point P (Fig 2.3). But it makes no reference to the test charge Q. The electric field is a vector quantity that varies from point to point and is determined by the configuration of source charges; physically, <script type="math/tex"> \vec{E}(\vec{r}) </script> is the force per unit charge that would be exerted on a test charge, if you were to place one at P.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 2.3" src="../img/2.3.png" /></p>
<p>What exactly <em>is</em> an electric field? I have deliberately begun with what you might call the "minimal" interpretation of <strong>E</strong>, as an intermediate step in the calculation of electric forces. But I encourage you to think of the field as a "real" physical entity, filling the space around electric charges. Maxwell himself came to believe that electric and magnetic fields are stresses and strains in an invisible primordial jellylike "ether." Special relativity has forced us to abandon the notion of either, and with it Maxwell's mechanical interpretation of electromagnetic fields. (It is even possible, although cumbersome, to formulate classical electrodynamics as an "action-at-a-distance" theory, and dispense with the field concept altogether.) I can't tell you, then, what a field <em>is</em> -- only how to calculate it and what it can do for you once you've got it.</p>
<h3 id="214-continuous-charge-distributions">2.1.4: Continuous Charge Distributions</h3>
<p>Our definition of the electric field (Eq. <script type="math/tex"> \eqref{2.4} </script> ) assumes that the source of the field is a collection of discrete point charges <script type="math/tex"> q_i </script>. If, instead, the charge is distributed continuously over some region, the sum becomes an integral (Fig 2.5a):
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\vec{E}(\vec{r}) = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \int \frac{1}{\gr ^2} \hat{\gr} \dd{q}
</script>
</p>
<p>If the charge is spread out along a <em>line</em> (Fig. 2.5b), with charge-per-unit-length <script type="math/tex"> \lambda </script> then <script type="math/tex"> \dd{q} = \lambda \dd{l}' </script> (where <script type="math/tex"> \dd{l}' </script> ) is an element of length along the line); if the charge is smeared out over a surface (Fig. 2.5c) with charge-per-unit-area <script type="math/tex"> \sigma </script>, then <script type="math/tex"> \dd{q} = \sigma \dd{a}' </script>  (where <script type="math/tex"> \dd{a'} </script> ) is an element of area on the surface); and if the charge fills a <em>volume</em> (Fig 2.5d), with charge-per-unit-volume <script type="math/tex"> \rho </script>, then <script type="math/tex"> \dd{q} = \rho\dd{\tau'} </script> (where <script type="math/tex"> \dd{\tau'} </script> is an element of volume):
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
dq \rightarrow \lambda \dd{l'} \sim \sigma \dd{a'} \sim \rho \dd{\tau'}
</script>
</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 2.5" src="../img/2.5.png" /></p>
<p>Thus the electric field of a line charge is
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\vec{E}(\vec{r}) = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \int \frac{\lambda(\vec{r'})}{\gr ^2} \hat{\gr} \dd{l'}
</script>
for a surface charge,
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\vec{E}(\vec{r}) = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \int \frac{\sigma(\vec{r'})}{\gr ^2} \hat{\gr} \dd{a'}
</script>
and for a volume charge,
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\vec{E}(\vec{r}) = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \int \frac{\rho(\vec{r'})}{\gr ^2} \hat{\gr} \dd{\tau'} \label{2.8}
</script>
</p>
<p>Equation <script type="math/tex"> \eqref{2.8} </script> itself is often referred to as "Coulomb's law," because it is such a short step from the original, and because a volume charge is in a sense the most general and realistic case. Please note carefully the meaning of <script type="math/tex"> \gr </script> in these formulas. Originally, in <script type="math/tex"> \eqref{2.4} </script>, <script type="math/tex"> \gr_i </script> stood for the vector from the source charge <script type="math/tex"> q_i </script> to the field point <strong>r</strong>. Correspondingly, in Eq.s 9-11, <script type="math/tex"> \gr </script> is the vector from <script type="math/tex"> \dd{q} </script> to the field point <script type="math/tex"> \vec{r} </script>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Warning: the unit vector <script type="math/tex"> \hat{\gr} </script> is not constant: its direction depends on the source point <script type="math/tex"> \vec{r'} </script>, and hence it cannot be taken outside the integrals (9-11). In practice, you must work with Cartesian components (<script type="math/tex"> \hat{x}, \hat{y}, \hat{z} </script> are constant, and do come out) , even if you use curvilinear coordinates to perform the integration.</p>

<h2 id="22-divergence-and-curl-of-electrostatic-fields">2.2: Divergence and Curl of Electrostatic Fields</h2>
<h3 id="221-field-lines-flux-and-gauss-law">2.2.1 Field Lines, Flux, and Gauss' Law</h3>
<p>In principle, we are <em>done</em> with the subject of electrostatics. Equation <script type="math/tex"> \eqref{2.8} </script> tells us how to compute the field of a charge distribution, and <script type="math/tex"> \eqref{2.3} </script> tells us what the force on a charge Q placed in this field will be. Unfortunately, as you may have discovered, the integrals involved in computing E can be formidable, even for reasonably simple charge distributions. Much of the rest of electrostatics is devoted to assembling a bag of tools and tricks for avoiding these integrals. It all begins with the divergence and curl of <strong>E</strong>. I shall calculate the divergence of <strong>E</strong> directly from <script type="math/tex"> \eqref{2.8} </script> in section 2.2.2, but first I want to show you a more qualitative, and perhaps more illuminating, intuitive approach.</p>
<p>Let's begin with the simplest possible case: a single point charge <em>q</em>, situated at the origin:
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\vec{E}(\vec{r}) = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{r^2} \hat{\vec{r}}
</script>
</p>
<p>To get a "feel" for this field, I might sketch a few representative vectors, as in Fig. 2.12a. Because the field falls off like <script type="math/tex"> 1/r^2 </script>, the vectors get shorter as you go farther away from the origin; they always point radially outward. But there is a nicer way to represent this field, and that's to connect up the arrows, to form <strong>field lines</strong> (Fig. 2.12b).</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 2.12" src="../img/2.12.png" /></p>
<p>You might think that I have thereby thrown away information about the <em>strength</em> of the field, which was contained in the length of the arrows. But actually I have not. The magnitude of the field is indicated by the <em>density</em> of the field lines: it's strong near the center where the field lines are close together, and weak farther out, where they are relatively far apart.</p>
<p>In truth, the field-line diagram is deceptive, when I draw it on a two-dimensional surface, for the density of lines passing through a circle of radius <em>r</em> is the total number divided by the circumference (<script type="math/tex"> n / 2 \pi r </script>), which goes like <script type="math/tex"> (1/r) </script>, not <script type="math/tex"> (1/r^2) </script>. But if you imagine the model in three dimensions (a pincushion with needles sticking out in all directions), then the density of lines is the total number divided by the area of the sphere <script type="math/tex"> (n/4 \pi r^2) </script>, which <em>does</em> go like <script type="math/tex"> (1/r^2) </script>.</p>
<p>Such diagrams are also convenient for representing more complicated fields. Of course, the number of lines you draw depends on how lazy you are (and how sharp your pencil is), though you ought to include enough to get an accurate sense of the field, and you must be consistent: if <script type="math/tex"> q </script>  gets 8 lines, then <script type="math/tex"> 2q </script>  deserves 16. And you must space them fairly - they emanate from a point charge symmetrically in all directions. Field lines begin on positive charges and end on negative ones; they cannot simply terminate in midair, though they may extend out to infinity. Moreover, field lines can never cross - at the intersection the field would have two different directions at once! With all this in mind, it is easy to sketch the field of any simple configuration of point charges: Begin by drawing the lines in the neighborhood of each charge, and then connect them up or extend them to infinity (Figs. 2.13 and 2.14)</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 2.13" src="../img/2.13.png" />
<img alt="Figure 2.14" src="../img/2.14.png" /></p>
<p>In this model, the <em>flux</em> of <strong>E</strong> through a surface S,
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\Phi_E \equiv \int _S \vec{E} \cdot \dd{\vec{a}} \label{2.11}
</script>
</p>
<p>is a measure of the "number of lines" passing through S. I put this in quotes because of course we can only draw a representative <em>sample</em> of field lines - the total number would be infinite. But for a given sampling rate the flux is <em>proportional</em> to the number of lines drawn, because the field strength, remember, is proportional to the density of field lines (the number per unit area), and hence <script type="math/tex"> \vec{E} \cdot \dd{\vec{a}} </script> is proportional to the number of lines passing through the infinitesimal area <script type="math/tex"> \dd{\vec{a}} </script>. (The dot product picks out the component of <script type="math/tex"> \dd{\vec{a}} </script> along the direction of <strong>E</strong>, as indicated in Fig 2.15. It is the area in the plane perpendicular to <strong>E</strong> that we have in mind when we say that the density of field lines is the number per unit area).</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 2.15" src="../img/2.15.png" />
<img alt="Figure 2.16" src="../img/2.16.png" /></p>
<p>This suggests that the flux through any <em>closed</em> surface is a measure of the total charge inside. For the field lines that originate on a positive charge must either pass out through the surface or else terminate on a negative charge inside (Fig 2.16a). On the other hand, a charge <em>outside</em> the surface will contribute nothing to the total flux, since its field lines pass in one side and out the other (Fig 2.16b). This is the <em>essence</em> of Gauss's law. Now let's make it quantitative.</p>
<p>In the case of a point charge <em>q</em> at the origin, the flux of <strong>E</strong> through a spherical surface or radius <em>r</em> is
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\oint \vec{E} \cdot \dd{\vec{a}} = \int \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \left( \frac{q}{r^2} \hat{r} \right) \cdot \left( r^2 \sin \theta \dd{\theta} \dd{\phi} \hat{r} \right) = \frac{1}{\epsilon_0} q \label{2.12}
</script>
</p>
<p>Notice that the radius of the sphere cancels out, for while the surface area goes <em>up</em> as <script type="math/tex"> r^2 </script>, the field goes <em>down</em> as <script type="math/tex"> 1/r^2 </script>, so the product is constant. In terms of the field-line picture, this makes good sense, since the same number of field lines pass through any sphere centered at the origin, regardless of its size. In fact, it didn't have to be a sphere - any closed surface, whatever its shape, would be pierced by the same number of field lines. Evidently, the flux through any surface enclosing the charge is <script type="math/tex"> q / \epsilon_0 </script>.</p>
<p>Now suppose that instead of a single charge at the origin, we have a bunch of charges scattered about. According to the principle of superposition, the total field is the (vector) sum of all the individual fields:
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\vec{E} = \sum _{i = 1} ^\nu \vec{E}_i
</script>
</p>
<p>The flux through a surface that encloses them all is
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\oint \vec{E} \cdot \dd{\vec{l}} = \sum _{i = 1}^n \left( \oint \vec{E_i} \cdot \dd{\vec{a}} \right) = \sum_{i = 1}^n \left( \frac{1}{\epsilon_0} q_i  \right)
</script>
</p>
<p>For any closed surface, then
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\oint \vec{E} \cdot \dd{\vec{a}} = \frac{1}{\epsilon_0} Q_{enc} \label{2.13}
</script>
</p>
<p>where <script type="math/tex"> Q_{enc} </script> is the total charge enclosed within the surface. This is the quantitative statement of Gauss's law. Although it contains no information that was not already present in Coulomb's law plus the principle of superposition, it is of almost magical power, as you will see in Sect. 2.2.3. Notice that it all hinges on the <script type="math/tex"> 1/r^2 </script> character of Coulomb's law; without that, the crucial cancellation of the <em>r</em>'s in <script type="math/tex"> \eqref{2.12} </script> would not take place, and the total flux of <strong>E</strong> would depend on the surface chosen, not merely on the total charge enclosed. Other <script type="math/tex"> 1/r^2 </script> forces (I am thinking particularly of Newton's law of universal gravitation) will obey "Gauss's laws" of their own, and the applications we develop here carry over directly.</p>
<p>As it stands, Gauss's law is an <em>integral</em> equation, but we can easily turn it into a differential one by applying the divergence theorem:
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\oint_{S} \vec{E} \cdot \dd{\vec{a}} = \int_{\mathscr{V}} (\div{\vec{E}}) \dd{\tau}
</script>
Rewriting <script type="math/tex"> Q_{enc} </script> in terms of the charge density <script type="math/tex"> \rho </script> we have
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
Q_{enc} = \int_{\mathscr{V}} \rho \dd{\tau}
</script>
So Gauss's law becomes
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\int_{\mathscr{V}} (\div{\vec{E}}) \dd{\tau} = \int_{\mathscr{V}} \left( \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0} \dd{\tau} \right)
</script>
And since this holds for <em>any</em> volume, the integrands must be equal:
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\nabla \cdot \vec{E} = \frac{1}{\epsilon_0} \rho \label{2.14}
</script>
</p>
<p>Equation <script type="math/tex"> \eqref{2.14} </script> carries the same message as <script type="math/tex"> \eqref{2.13} </script>; it is <strong>Gauss's law in differential form</strong>. The differential version is tidier, but the integral form has the advantage that it accommodates point, line, and surface charges more naturally.</p>
<h3 id="222-the-divergence-of-e">2.2.2: The Divergence of E</h3>
<p>Let's go back now, and calculate the divergence of <script type="math/tex"> \vec{E} </script> directly from <script type="math/tex"> \eqref{2.8} </script>:
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\vec{E}(\vec{r}) = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \int_{\text{all space}} \frac{\hat{\gr}}{\gr ^2} \rho(\vec{r}') \dd{\tau'} \label{2.15}
</script>
</p>
<p>(Originally the integration was over the volume occupied by the charge, but I may as well extend it to all space, since <script type="math/tex"> \rho = 0 </script> in the exterior region anyway.) Noting that the r-dependence is contained in <script type="math/tex"> \gr = r - r' </script>, we have
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\div{\vec{E}} = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \int \vec{\nabla} \cdot \left( \frac{\hat{\gr}}{\gr^2}  \right) \rho(\vec{r'}) \dd{\tau'} 
</script>
We calculated this divergence in Section 1.5:
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\div{\left( \frac{\hat{\gr}}{\gr^2}  \right)} = 4 \pi \delta ^3(\gr)
</script>
Thus
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\div{\vec{E}} = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \int 4 \pi \delta^3(\vec{r} - \vec{r'}) \rho(\vec{r'}) \dd{\tau'} = \frac{1}{\epsilon_0} \rho(\vec{r}) \label{2.16}
</script>
which is Gauss's law in differential form <script type="math/tex"> \eqref{2.14} </script>. To recover the integral form <script type="math/tex"> \eqref{2.13} </script> we run the previous argument in reverse - integrate over a volume and apply the divergence theorem:
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\int_{\mathscr{V}} \div{\vec{E}} \dd{\tau} = \oint_{\mathscr{S}} \vec{E} \cdot \dd{\vec{a}} = \frac{1}{\epsilon_0} \int_{\mathscr{V}} \rho \dd{\tau} = \frac{1}{\epsilon_0} Q_{enc}
</script>
</p>
<h3 id="223-applications-of-gausss-law">2.2.3: Applications of Gauss's Law</h3>
<p>I must interrupt the theoretical development at this point to show you the extraordinary power of Gauss's law, in integral form. When symmetry permits, it affords <em>by far</em> the quickest and easiest way of computing electric fields. I'll illustrate the method with a series of examples.</p>
<hr />
<h4 id="example-23">Example 2.3</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Find the field outside a uniformly charged solid sphere of radius R and total charge q</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>
Imagine a spherical surface at radius <script type="math/tex"> r > R </script> (Fig. 2.18). This is called a <strong>Gaussian surface</strong> in the trade. Gauss's law says that
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\oint_{\mathscr{S}} \vec{E} \cdot \dd{\vec{a}} = \frac{1}{\epsilon_0} Q_{enc}
</script>
and in this case <script type="math/tex"> Q_{enc} = q </script>. At first glance this doesn't seem to get us very far, because the quantity we want (E) is buried inside the surface integral. Luckily, symmetry allows us to extract E from under the integral sign: <strong>E</strong> certainly points radially outward, as does <script type="math/tex"> \dd{\vec{a}} </script>, so we can drop the dot product
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\int_{\mathscr{S}} \vec{E} \cdot \dd{\vec{a}} = \int_{\mathscr{S}} | \vec{E} | da
</script>
</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 2.18" src="../img/2.18.png" /></p>
<p>and the magnitude of E is constant over the Gaussian surface, so it comes outside the integral:
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\int_{S} | E | da = |E| \int_{S} da = E 4 \pi r^2
</script>
Thus
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
|\vec{E}|4\pi r^2 = \frac{1}{\epsilon_0} q
</script>
or
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\vec{E} = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{r^2} \hat{r}
</script>
</p>
<p>Notice a remarkable feature of this result: the field outside the sphere is exactly the same as it would have been if all the charge had been concentrated at the center.</p>
<hr />
<p>Gauss's law is always <em>true</em>, but not always <em>useful</em>. If <script type="math/tex"> \rho </script> had not been uniform (or at any rate, not spherically symmetrical), or if I had chosen some other shape for my Gaussian surface, it would have still been true that the flux of <script type="math/tex"> \vec{E} </script> is <script type="math/tex"> q / \epsilon_0 </script>, but <script type="math/tex"> \vec{E} </script> would not have pointed in the same direction as <script type="math/tex"> \dd{\vec{a}} </script>, and its magnitude would not have been constant over the surface, and without that I cannot get <script type="math/tex"> |\vec{E}| </script> outside the integral. Symmetry is crucial to this application of Gauss's law. As far as I know, there are only three kinds of symmetry that work:</p>
<ol>
<li>Spherical symmetry. Make your Gaussian survace a concentric sphere.</li>
<li>Cylindrical symmetry. Make your Gaussian surface a coaxial cylinder.</li>
<li>Plane symmetry. Use a Gaussian "pillbox" that straddles the surface.</li>
</ol>
<p>Although 2 and 3 technically require infinitely long cylinders, and planes extending to infinity, we shall often use them to get approximate answers for "long" cylinders or "large" planes, at points far from the edges.</p>
<hr />
<h4 id="example-24">Example 2.4</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>A long cylinder (Fig 2.21) carries a charge density that is proportional to the distance from the axis: <script type="math/tex"> \rho = ks </script> for some constant <script type="math/tex"> k </script>. Find the electric field inside this cylinder.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Figure 2.21" src="../img/2.21.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Draw a Gaussian cylinder of length l and radius s. For this surface, Gauss's law states
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\oint_{\mathscr{S}} \vec{E} \cdot \dd{\vec{a}} = \frac{1}{\epsilon_0} Q_{enc}
</script>
</p>
<p>The enclosed charge is
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\begin{align}
Q_{enc} & = & \int \rho \dd{\tau} \\
& = & \int(ks')(s' \dd{s'} \dd{\phi} \dd{z}) \\
& = & 2 \pi k l \int_{0}^{s} s'^2 \dd{s'} \\
& = & \frac{2}{3} \pi k l s^3
\end{align}
</script>
</p>
<p>(I used the volume element appropriate to cylindrical coordinates, and integrated <script type="math/tex"> \phi </script> from <script type="math/tex"> 0 </script> to <script type="math/tex"> 2\pi </script>, <script type="math/tex"> \dd{z} </script> from <script type="math/tex"> 0 </script> to <script type="math/tex"> l </script>. I put a prime on the integration variable <script type="math/tex"> s' </script> to distinguish it from the radius <script type="math/tex"> s </script> of the Gaussian surface.)</p>
<p>Now, symmetry dictates that <script type="math/tex"> \vec{E} </script> must point radially outward, so for the curved portion of the Gaussian cylinder we have:
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\int \vec{E} \cdot \dd{\vec{a}} = \int | \vec{E}| da = | \vec{E}| \int da = |\vec{E} 2 \pi s l
</script>
while the two ends contribute nothing (here <script type="math/tex"> \vec{E} </script> is perpendicular to <script type="math/tex"> \dd{\vec{a}} </script>). Thus,
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
|\vec{E} | 2 \pi s l = \frac{1}{\epsilon_0} \frac{2}{3} \pi k l s^3
</script>
or, finally,
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\vec{E} = \frac{1}{3\epsilon_0} k s^2 \hat{s}
</script>
</p>
<hr />
<h4 id="example-25">Example 2.5</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>An infinite plane carries a uniform surface charge <script type="math/tex"> \sigma </script>. Find its electric field.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>
Draw a Gaussian pillbox, extending equal distances above and below the plane (Fig. 2.22). Apply Gauss's law to this surface:
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\oint \vec{E} \cdot \dd{\vec{a}} = \frac{1}{\epsilon_0} Q_{enc}
</script>
</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 2.22" src="../img/2.22.png" /></p>
<p>In this case, <script type="math/tex"> Q = \sigma A </script>, where A is the area of the lid of the pillbox. By symmetry, <script type="math/tex"> \vec{E} </script> points away from the plane (upward for points above, downward for points below). So the top and bottom surfaces yield
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\int \vec{E} \cdot \dd{\vec{a}} = 2 A |\vec{E}|,
</script>
whereas the sides contribute nothing. Thus
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
2 A | \vec{E} | = \frac{1}{\epsilon_0} \sigma A 
</script>
</p>
<p>or
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\vec{E} = \frac{\sigma}{2 \epsilon_0} \hat{n}
</script>
</p>
<p>where <script type="math/tex"> \hat{n} </script> is a unit vector pointing away from the surface. In Prob 2.6, you obtained this same result by a much more laborious method.</p>
<p>It seems surprising, at first, that the field of an infinite plane is <em>independent of how fara away you are</em>. What about the <script type="math/tex"> 1/r^2 </script> in Coulomb's law? The point is that as you move farther and farther away from the plane, more and more charge comes into your "field of view," and this compensates for the diminishing influence of any particular piece. The electric field of a sphere falls off like <script type="math/tex"> 1/r^2 </script>; the electric field of an infinite line falls off like <script type="math/tex"> 1/r </script>; and the electric field of an infinite plane does not fall off at all (you cannot escape from an infinite plane).</p>
<p>Although the direct use of Gauss's law to compute fields is limited to cases of spherical, cylindrical, and planar symmetry, we can put together combinations of objects posessing such symmetry, even though the arrangement as a whole is not symmetrical. For example, invoking the principle of superposition, we could find the field in the vicinity of two uniformly charged parallel cylinders, or a sphere near an infinite charged plane.</p>
<hr />
<h4 id="example-26">Example 2.6</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Two infinite parallel planes carry equal but opposite uniform charge densities <script type="math/tex"> \pm \sigma </script> (Fig 2.23). Find the field in each of the three regions: (i) to the left of both, (ii) between them, (iii) to the right of both.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="Figure 2.23" src="../img/2.23.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>The left plate produces a field <script type="math/tex"> (1/2 \epsilon_0)\sigma </script>, which points away from it (Fig. 2.24) to the left in region in (i) and to the right in regions (ii) and (iii). The right plate, being negatively charged, produces a field <script type="math/tex"> (1/2 \epsilon_0)\sigma </script> which points <em>toward</em> it - to the right in regions (i) and (ii) and to the left in region (iii). The two fields cancel in regions (i) and (iii); they conspire in region (ii). Conclusion: The field between the plates is <script type="math/tex"> \sigma / \epsilon_0 </script>, and points to the right; elsewhere it is zero.</p>
<h3 id="224-the-curl-of-e">2.2.4: The Curl of E</h3>
<p>I'll calculate the curl of <script type="math/tex"> \vec{E} </script> as I did the divergence in Sect 2.2.1, by studying first the simplest possible configuration: a point charge at the origin. In this case
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
  \vec{E} = \frac{1}{4\pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{r^2} \hat{r} 
  </script>
<br />
Now, a glance at Fig 2.12 should convince you that the curl of this field has to be zero, but I suppose we ought to come up with something a little more rigorous than that. What if we calculate the line integral of this field from some point <script type="math/tex"> \vec{a} </script> to some other point <script type="math/tex"> \vec{b} </script> (Fig 2.29):
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\int_{\vec{a}}^{\vec{b}} \vec{E} \cdot \dd{\vec{l}}
</script>
</p>
<p>In spherical coordinates, <script type="math/tex"> \dd{\vec{l}} = \dd{r} \hat{r} + r \dd{\theta} \hat{\theta} + r \sin \theta \dd{\phi} \hat{\phi} </script>, so 
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\vec{E} \cdot \dd{\vec{l}} = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{1}{r^2} \dd{r}
</script>
</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 2.29" src="../img/2.29.png" /></p>
<p>Therefore,
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\int_{\vec{a}}^{\vec{b}} \vec{E} \cdot \dd{\vec{l}} = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \int_{a}^{b} \frac{q}{r^2} \dd{r} \\ 
= \left.\frac{-1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{r} \right|_{r_a} ^{r_b} \\
= \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \left( \frac{q}{r_a} - \frac{q}{r_b}  \right)
</script>
The integral around a <em>closed</em> path is evidently zero (for then <script type="math/tex"> r_a = r_b </script> ):
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\oint \vec{E} \cdot \dd\vec{l} = 0 \label{2.19}
</script>
and hence, applying Stokes' theorem
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\curl{\vec{E}} = 0 \label{2.20}
</script>
</p>
<p>Now, I proved eqs. <script type="math/tex"> \eqref{2.19} </script> and <script type="math/tex"> \eqref{2.20} </script> only for the field of a single point charge at the origin, but these results make no reference to what is, after all, a perfectly arbitrary choice of coordinates; they hold no matter where the charge is located. Moreover, if we have many charges, the principle of superposition states that the total field is a vector sum of their individual fields:
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
 \vec{E} = \vec{E_1} + \vec{E_2} + \ldots
 </script> 
so
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\curl{\vec{E}} = \curl{(\vec{E_1} + \vec{E_2} + \ldots)} = (\curl{\vec{E_1}}) + (\curl{\vec{E_2}}) + \ldots = 0
</script>
</p>
<p>Thus, Eqs.  <script type="math/tex"> \eqref{2.19} </script> and <script type="math/tex"> \eqref{2.20} </script> hold for any <em>static</em> charge distribution whatever.</p>
<h2 id="23-electric-potential">2.3: Electric Potential</h2>
<h3 id="231-introduction-to-potential">2.3.1: Introduction to Potential</h3>
<p>The electric field <strong>E</strong> is not just <em>any</em> old vector function. It is a very special <em>kind</em> of vector function: one whose curl id zero. <script type="math/tex"> \vec{E} = y \hat{x} </script> , for example, could not possibly be an electrostatic field; <em>no</em> set of charges, regardless of their sizes and positions, could ever produce such a field. We're going to exploit this special property of electric fields to reduce a <em>vector</em> problem (finding <strong>E</strong>) to a much simpler <em>scalar</em> problem. The first theorem in Sect 1.6.2 asserts that any vector whose curl is zero is equal to the gradient of some scalar. What I'm going to do now amounts to a proof of that claim, in the context of electrostatics.</p>
<p><img alt="Figure 2.30" src="../img/2.30.png" /></p>
<p>Because <script type="math/tex"> \nabla \cross \vec{E} = 0</script> , the line integral of <strong>E</strong> around any closed loop is zero (that follows from Stokes' theorem). Because <script type="math/tex"> \oint \vec{E} \cdot \dd{\vec{l}} = 0 </script>, the line integral of <strong>E</strong> from point <strong>a</strong> to point <strong>b</strong> is the same for all paths (otherwise you could go <em>out</em> along path (i) and return along path (ii) - Fig 2.30 - and obtain <script type="math/tex"> \oint \vec{E} \cdot \dd{\vec{l}} \neq 0 </script> ). Because the line integral is independent of path, we can define a function
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
V(\vec{r}) \equiv - \int _{O} ^{\vec{r}} \vec{E} \cdot \dd{\vec{l}} \label{2.21}
</script>
</p>
<p>Here <script type="math/tex"> O </script> is some standard reference point on which we have agreed beforehand; V then depends only on the point <script type="math/tex"> \vec{r} </script>. It is called the <strong>electric potential</strong>.</p>
<p>The potential <em>difference</em> between two points <strong>a</strong> and <strong>b</strong> is
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\begin{align}
V(\vec{b}) - V(\vec{a}) & = & -\int_{O}^{\vec{b}} \vec{E}\cdot \dd{\vec{l}} + \int_{O}^{\vec{a}} \vec{E} \cdot \dd{\vec{l}} \\
& = & -\int_{O}^{\vec{b}} \vec{E}\cdot \dd{\vec{l}} - \int_{\vec{a}}^{O} \vec{E}\cdot \dd{\vec{l}} \\
& = & - \int_{\vec{a}} ^{\vec{b}} \vec{E}\cdot \dd{\vec{l}}
\end{align}
</script>
</p>
<p>Now, the fundamental theorem for gradients states that
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
V(\vec{b}) - V(\vec{a}) = \int_{\vec{a}} ^{\vec{b}} (\grad{V}) \cdot \dd{\vec{l}}
</script>
so
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\int_{\vec{a}}^{\vec{b}} (\grad{V})\cdot \dd{\vec{l}} = - \int_{\vec{a}}^{\vec{b}} \vec{E}\cdot \dd{\vec{l}}
</script>
Since, finally, this is true for <em>any</em> points <strong>a</strong> and <strong>b</strong>, the integrands must be equal:
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\vec{E} = - \grad{V} \label{e-equals-grad-v}
</script>
</p>
<p>Equation <script type="math/tex"> \eqref{e-equals-grad-v} </script> is the differential version of <script type="math/tex"> \eqref{2.21} </script>; it says that the electric field is the gradient of a scalar potential, which is what we set out to prove.</p>
<p>Notice the subtle but crucial role played by path independence (or, equivalently, the fact that <script type="math/tex"> \nabla \times \vec{E} = 0 </script> ) in this argument. If the line integral of <strong>E</strong> depended on the path taken, then the "definition" of V <script type="math/tex"> \eqref{2.21} </script> would be nonsense. It simply would not define a function, since changing the path would alter the value of <script type="math/tex"> V(\vec{r}) </script>. By the way, don't let the minus sign in <script type="math/tex"> \eqref{e-equals-grad-v} </script> distract you; it carries over from <script type="math/tex"> \eqref{2.21} </script> and is largely a matter of convention.</p>
<h3 id="232-comments-on-potential">2.3.2: Comments on Potential</h3>
<p><strong>The name</strong>. The word "potential" is a hideous misnomer because it inevitably reminds you of potential <em>energy</em>. This is particularly insidious, because there <em>is</em> a connection between "potential" and "potential energy," as you will see in Sect 2.4. I'm sorry that it is impossible to escape this word. The best I can do is to insist once and for all that "potential" and "potential energy" are completely different terms and should, by all rights, have different names. Incidentially, a surface over which the potential is constant is called an <strong>equipotential</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Advantage of the potential formulation</strong>. If you know V, you can easily get <strong>E</strong> - just take the gradient: <script type="math/tex"> \vec{E} =- \grad{V} </script>. This is quite extraordinary when you stop to think about it, for <strong>E</strong> is a <em>vector</em> quantity (three components), but V is a <strong>scalar</strong> (one component). How can one function possibly contain all the information that three independent functions carry? The answer is that the three components of <strong>E</strong> are not really as independent as they look; in fact, they are explicitly interrelated by the very condition we started with,<script type="math/tex"> \nabla \times \vec{E} = 0 </script>. In terms of components,
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\pdv{E_x}{y} = \pdv{E_y}{x}, \qquad \pdv{E_z}{y} = \pdv{E_y}{z}, \qquad \pdv{E_x}{z} = \pdv{E_z}{x}
</script>
</p>
<p>This brings us back to my observation at the beginning of Sect 2.3.1: <strong>E</strong> is a very special kind of vector.What the potential formulation does is to exploit this feature to maximum advantage, reducing a vector problem to a scalar one, in which there is no need to fuss with components.</p>
<p><strong>The reference point <script type="math/tex"> \mathscr{O} </script></strong>. There is an essential ambiguity in the definition of potential, since the choice of reference point <script type="math/tex"> \mathscr{O} </script> was arbitrary. Changing reference points amounts to adding a constant K to the potential:
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
V'(r) =  -\int_{\mathscr{O}'}^{\vec{r}} \vec{E} \cdot \dd{\vec{l}} \\ 
= - \int_{\mathscr{O}'} ^{\mathscr{O}} \vec{E} \cdot \dd{\vec{l}} - \int_{\mathscr{O}}^{\vec{r}} \vec{E} \cdot \dd{\vec{l}} \\
=  K + V(\vec{r})
</script>
</p>
<p>where K is the line integral of <strong>E</strong> from the old reference point <script type="math/tex"> \mathscr{O} </script> to the new one <script type="math/tex"> \mathscr{O}' </script>. Of course, adding a constant to V will not affect the potential <em>difference</em> between two points, since the K's cancel out. Nor does the ambiguity affect the gradient of V:
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\grad{V'} = \grad{V} 
</script>
since the derivative of a constant is zero. That's why all such V's, differing only in their choice of reference point, correspond to the same field <strong>E</strong></p>
<p>Potential as such carries no real physical significance, for at any given point we can adjust its value at will by suitable relocation of <script type="math/tex"> \mathscr{O} </script>. In this sense, it is rather like altitude: if I ask you how high Denver is, you will probably tell me its height above sea level, because that is a convenient and traditional reference point. But we could as well agree to measure altitude above Washington, DC, or Greenwich, or wherever. That would add (or rather, subtract) a fixed amount from all our sea-level readings, but it wouldn't change anything about the real world. The only quantity of interest is the <em>difference</em> in altitude between two points, and that is the same whatever your reference level.</p>
<p>Having said this, however, there is a "natural" spot to use for <script type="math/tex"> \mathscr{O} </script> in electrostatics - analogous to sea level for altitude - and that is a point infinitely far from the charge. Ordinarily, then, we s"set the zero of potential at infinity." (Since <script type="math/tex"> V(\mathscr{O}) = 0 </script>, choosing a reference point is equivalent to selecting a place where <script type="math/tex"> V </script> is to be zero.) But I must warn you that there is one special circumstance in which this convention fails: when the charge distribution itself extends to infinity. The symptom of trouble, in such cases, is that the potential blows up. For instance, the field of a uniformly charged plane is <script type="math/tex"> (\sigma / 2 \epsilon_0) \hat{n} </script>, as we found in Ex 2.5; if we naively put <script type="math/tex"> \mathscr{O} = \infty </script>, then the potential at height <em>z</em> above the plane becomes
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
V(z) = - \int_{\infty}^{z}\frac{1}{2\epsilon_0} \sigma \dd{z} = - \frac{1}{2\epsilon_0} \sigma(z - \infty)
</script> 
The remedy is simply to choose some other reference point (in this example you might use a point on the plane). Notice that the difficulty occurs only in textbook problems; in "real life" there is no such thing as a charge distribution that goes on forever, and we can <em>always</em> use infinity as our reference point.</p>
<p><strong>Potential obeys the superposition principle</strong>. The original superposition principle pertains to the force on a test charge Q. It says that the total force on <em>Q</em> is the vector sum of the forces attributable to the source charges individually:
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\vec{F} = \vec{F_1} + \vec{F_2} + \ldots
</script>
Dividing through by Q, we see that the electric field, too, obeys the superposition principle:
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\vec{E} = \vec{E_1} + \vec{E_2} + \ldots
</script>
Integrating from the common reference point to <script type="math/tex"> \vec{r} </script>, it follows that the potential also satisfies such a principle:
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
V = V_1 + V_2 + \ldots

That is, the potential at any given point is the sum of the potentials due to all the source charges separately. Only this time it is an <em>ordinary</em> sum, not a vector sum, which makes it a lot easier to work with.</p>
<p><strong>Units of Potential</strong>. In our units, force is measured in newtons and charge in coulombs, so electric fields are in newtons per coulomb. Accordingly, potential is newton-meters per coulomb, or joules per coulomb. A joule per coulomb is a <strong>volt</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="233-poissons-equation-and-laplaces-equation">2.3.3: Poisson's Equation and Laplace's Equation</h3>
<p>We found in Sect 2.3.1 that the electric field can be written as the gradient of a scalar potential
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\vec{E} = - \grad{V}
</script>
The question arises, what do the divergence and curl of <strong>E</strong>,
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\div{\vec{E}} = \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0} \qquad \text{ and } \qquad \curl{\vec{E}} = 0
</script>
look like, in terms of V? Well, <script type="math/tex"> \div{\vec{E}} = \div(-\grad{V}) = -\laplacian{V} </script>, so, apart from that persistent minus sign, the divergence of <strong>E</strong> is the Laplacian of V. Gauss's law, then, says
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\laplacian{V} = -\frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0} \label{2.24}
</script>
</p>
<p>This is known as <strong>Poisson's equation</strong>. In regions where there is no charge, so <script type="math/tex"> \rho = 0 </script>, Poisson's equation reduces to Laplace's equation,
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\laplacian{V} = 0 \label{2.25}
</script>
</p>
<p>We'll explore this equation more fully in Chapter 3.</p>
<p>So much for Gauss's law. What about the curl law? This says that
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\curl{\vec{E}} = \curl(-\grad{V}) = 0
</script>
</p>
<p>But that's no condition on V - curl of gradient is <em>always</em> zero. Of course, we used the curl law to show that <strong>E</strong> could be expressed as the gradient of a scalar, so it's not really surprising that this works out: <script type="math/tex"> \curl{\vec{E}} = 0 </script> permits our definition of V; in return, <script type="math/tex"> \vec{E} = - \grad{V} </script> guarantees <script type="math/tex"> \curl{\vec{E}} = 0 </script>. It only takes one differential equation (Poisson's) to determine V, because V is a scalar. For <script type="math/tex"> \vec{E} </script> we needed two, the divergence and the curl.</p>
<h3 id="234-the-potential-of-a-localized-charge-distribution">2.3.4: The potential of a Localized Charge Distribution</h3>
<p>I defined V in terms of <script type="math/tex"> \vec{E} \eqref{2.21} </script>. Ordinarily, though, it's <strong>E</strong> that we're looking for (if we already knew <strong>E</strong>, there wouldn't be much point in calculating V). The idea is that it might be easier to get V first, and then calculate <strong>E</strong> by taking the gradient. Typically, then, we know where the charge is (that is, we know <script type="math/tex"> \rho </script>), and we want to find V. Now, Poisson's equation relates V and <script type="math/tex"> \rho </script>, but unfortunately it's "the wrong way round": it would give us <script type="math/tex"> \rho </script> if we knew V, whereas we want V, knowing <script type="math/tex"> \rho </script>. What we must do, then, is "invert" Poisson's equation. That's the program for this section, although I shall do it by roundabout means, beginning, as always, with a point charge at the origin.</p>
<p>The electric field is <script type="math/tex"> \vec{E} = (1 / 4 \pi \epsilon_0)(1 / r^2) \hat{r} </script>, and <script type="math/tex"> \dd{\vec{l}} = \dd{r} \hat{r}  </script>, and <script type="math/tex"> \dd{\vec{l}} = \dd{r} \hat{r} + r \dd{\theta} \hat{\theta} + r \sin \theta \dd{\theta} \hat{\phi} </script>, so
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
\vec{E} \cdot \dd{\vec{l}} = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{r^2} \dd{r} 
</script>
Setting the reference point at infinity, the potential of a point charge <em>q</em> at the origin is
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
V(r) = - \int_{\mathscr{O}} ^r \vec{E} \cdot \dd{\vec{l}} \\
 = \frac{-1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \int_{\infty}^r \frac{q}{r' ^2} \dd{r'} \\
 = \left.\frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{r'} \right| ^r _{\infty} = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{r} 
</script>
</p>
<p>(You see here the advantage of using infinity for the reference point: it kills the lower limit on the integral.) Notice the sign of V; presumably the conventional minus sign in the definition was chosen in order to make the potential of a positive charge come out positive. It is useful to remember that regions of positive charge are potential "hills," and electric field points "downhill" from plus toward minus.</p>
<p>In general, the potential of a point charge q is
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
V(\vec{r}) = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{q}{\gr} 
</script>
</p>
<p>where <script type="math/tex"> \gr </script>, as always, is the distance from <script type="math/tex"> q </script> to <script type="math/tex"> \vec{r} </script> (Fig 2.32). Invoking the superposition principle, then, the potential of a collection of charges is</p>

<h3 id="241-the-work-it-takes-to-move-a-charge">2.4.1: The Work it Takes to Move a Charge</h3>
<p>Suppose you have a stationary configuration of source charges, and you want to move a test charge Q from point a to point b (Fig. 2.39). <em>Question</em>: how much work will you have to do? At any point along the path, the electric force on Q is <script type="math/tex"> \vec{F} = Q \vec{E} </script>; the force you must exert, in opposition to the electric force, is <script type="math/tex"> -Q\vec{E} </script>. The work you do is therefore
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
W = \int_{a}^{b} \vec{F} \cdot \dd{\vec{l}} =  \\
 - Q \int_{a}^{b} \vec{E} \cdot \dd{\vec{l}} = \\
 - Q[V(b) - V(a)]
</script>
</p>
<p>Notice that the answer is independent of the path you take from a to b; in mechanics, then, we would call the electrostatic force "conservative." Dividing through by Q, we have
<script type="math/tex; mode=display">
V(b) - V(a) = \frac{W}{Q}
